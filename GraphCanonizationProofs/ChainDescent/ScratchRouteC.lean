# Route C — the spanning-base generalization of the orthogonal-form seal (F5 / A3 first brick)

**What this module builds.** Route C (`docs/chain-descent-route-c-plan.md`) recovers the quadratic form `Q` from the
abstract graph and then works with the **isometry** scheme `O(Q)`, whose discretization at a base is the landed
`reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2704`). But that theorem uses the **literal standard
frame** `{0, e₁, …, e_d}` (`frameBase`) — and Route C, working from an abstract graph, has **no canonical standard
coordinates**: it must individualize an *iso-invariantly chosen* base. So the necessary first brick is to generalize
the seal from the standard frame to **any base whose difference-vectors span `V`**.

**What it proves (both axiom-clean, `lake env lean`, NOT in `build.sh`):**
* `coords_determine_spanning` — the spanning generalization of the landed `coords_determine` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2640`):
  if `Q`'s polar form is nondegenerate and the `Q`-values `Q v`, `Q (v − s)` agree with `v'` on a set `S` that
  **spans** `V`, then `v = v'`. (Same `Q`-value profile ⟹ same polar coordinates on a spanning set ⟹ by
  nondegeneracy, same vector.) Mirrors `coords_determine`'s proof, replacing the `Pi.basisFun` finish with
  `LinearMap.ext_on` on the spanning set.
* `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` — the spanning generalization of
  `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm`: for any base `T ∋ o` whose difference-vectors `{t̄ − ō : t ∈ T}` span
  `V`, the affine isometry scheme discretizes at `T` and seals via `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaSpielman`. Carries NO
  `hSmallAutThin`. The standard-frame theorem is the special case `T = frameBase`, `o = 0`.
* `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` (**A3, brick 1**) — since `O(Q) ≤ GO(Q)` (`isometry_le_similitude`), the
  isometry scheme (exact-`Q` relations) refines the given **similitude** graph (isotropy-only relations): equal isometry
  relation ⟹ equal similitude relation. The consistency half of the refinement bridge — the recovered form gives
  relations finer than, and consistent with, the given graph. Pure `H ≤ G ⟹` finer orbitals (no Witt / orbit-structure).

**Scope / place in the plan.** The two spanning theorems are the **isometry-scheme** discretization at an arbitrary
spanning base — the back-half Route C rides on once `Q` is recovered (F1 `route_c_f1_probe.py` / `AffineStructureRecovery`
+ A1 `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` / `QuadraticFormRecovery`, both DONE + confirmed in C#). `isometryScheme_refines_
similitudeScheme` is A3's brick 1.

**F4 (iso-invariance of the recovered form) — equivariance core now LANDED (F4 section below):**
`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` + bricks `similitude_colouring_equivariant` / `similitude_conePreserving`. The one
non-elementary link is `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` (same isotropic cone ⟹ scalar-multiple form = A1's `vanishDim=1`
uniqueness; the EXACT scoped classical theorem, `p≠2`/`d≥4`), named + carried as a classical citation (Hirschfeld,
projective Nullstellensatz for a nondegenerate quadric) — so **F4 and A1's Lean side unify into one carried fact**, the
equivariance proved around it. Remaining Route-C open items: that classical carry + the meta-poly bootstrapping (F1
consumes `Aut`, whose poly recovery for this residue is the open T0 problem — see the plan's STATUS "OPEN — meta-poly
bootstrapping"). Full pickup: `docs/chain-descent-route-c-plan.md` STATUS + §6a. See §4 for the preexisting-lemma names.

/-- **The spanning generalization of `coords_determine`.** With a nondegenerate polar form, the `Q`-value profile at a
base `S` that **spans** `V` determines the vector: if `Q v = Q v'` and `Q (v − s) = Q (v' − s)` for every `s ∈ S`, and
`span S = ⊤`, then `v = v'`. Proof mirrors `coords_determine` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2640`): the `Q`-value equalities give
`polar Q v s = polar Q v' s` (via `polar_eq_of_sub`), so `polarBilin (v − v')` vanishes on the spanning set `S`, hence
everywhere (`LinearMap.ext_on`), hence — by nondegeneracy — `v = v'`. Generalizes the standard-frame `coords_determine`
to an arbitrary spanning base (cf. the abstract `BranchDepth.spanning_sameExactGram_determines`). -/

/-- **THE SEAL VIA THE ORTHOGONAL FORM AT A SPANNING BASE (Route C back-half, generalizing Stage B.0).**
For any quadratic form `Q` on `F_p^d` with nondegenerate polar form, and any base `T ∋ o` whose difference-vectors
`{t̄ − ō : t ∈ T}` (`t̄ = affineE.symm t`) **span** `V`, the affine scheme of the isometry group `O(Q)` individualizes
to discrete at `T` and seals. Mechanism (depth-1): under `O(Q)` the orbit-of-difference determines `Q(v − t)`, and the
`Q`-values at the spanning base recover the vector (`coords_determine_spanning`). **Carries NO `hSmallAutThin`.**
Generalizes `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2704`) off the literal standard frame
`frameBase` — the generalization Route C needs, since an abstract graph has no canonical standard coordinates and must
individualize an iso-invariantly chosen spanning base. Honest scope: `O(Q)` is the *finer* isometry scheme, not the
given rank-3 SRG `VO^ε` (= similitude `GO(Q)`); the A3 refinement bridge (recovered `Q` refines the given graph to this
scheme) is separate (`docs/chain-descent-route-c-plan.md` §4/§6). Axiom-clean. -/

/-! ## A3 — the refinement bridge (recovered `Q` upgrades the similitude graph to the isometry scheme)

The GIVEN forms graph is the **similitude** scheme `affineScheme (similitudeGroup Q)` — its relation records
only the isotropy class of a difference (the `GO(Q)`-orbit). Route C recovers `Q` (F1 + A1, confirmed in C#)
and works with the **isometry** scheme `affineScheme (isometryGroup Q)`, whose relation is the *exact*
`Q`-value of the difference (the `O(Q)`-orbit) — and which the landed
`reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` discretizes at a spanning base. The bridge has two halves:
this brick (the isometry scheme *refines* the given graph — so using the recovered form is consistent, not
fabricated) and F4 (the recovered form is iso-invariant — separate). -/

/-- **A3, brick 1 — the isometry scheme refines the similitude scheme.** Since `O(Q) ≤ GO(Q)`
(`isometry_le_similitude`), the affine orbital scheme of the isometry group is FINER than that of the
similitude group: whenever the isometry scheme assigns two pairs the same relation, so does the similitude
scheme. This is the formal sense in which the recovered form `Q` (whose exact-value-of-difference data IS the
isometry relation) *refines* the given similitude graph (isotropy-only) rather than fabricating structure —
the consistency half of the Route-C bridge. Pure `H ≤ G ⟹` finer orbitals; no Witt / orbit-structure needed.

/-! ## F4 — iso-invariance of the recovered form (the recovered-`Q` colouring is relabeling-equivariant)

The Route-C spine (recover `Q` → isometry scheme refines the graph (A3 brick 1) → discretizes at a
spanning base (`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning`)) yields an iso-invariant discrete colouring **only if** the
recovered `Q` is itself iso-invariant. Concretely: a graph isomorphism between two affine-polar graphs is,
after F1 coordinatization, a linear map `g` carrying the isotropic cone of `Q` onto the cone of `Q'`
(`Q v = 0 ↔ Q' (g v) = 0`) — and F4 must conclude that the recovered-`Q` **difference colouring** is then
carried correspondingly (`Q' (g u − g t) = μ · Q (u − t)`), the `forcedNode_relabel` analog for the form.

**The honest split (this resolves the plan's "only F4 remains" — F4 and A1's Lean side are two faces of
one classical fact).** The chain *graph iso → linear `g` with cone-preservation → `g` is a form similitude
→ colouring equivariant* has exactly one non-elementary link: **cone-preservation ⟹ similitude**, i.e.
"a nondegenerate quadric determines its quadratic form up to a nonzero scalar". That is precisely A1's
finite-geometry content (probe-confirmed `vanishDim = 1`, `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py`) and is carried
here as the **exact scoped** named premise `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` (`p ≠ 2`, `4 ≤ d`, `Q` nondeg — the
range where it is TRUE; the unrestricted form is false at `d=3,q=3`) — a classical citation, same discipline
as Witt/G3. Everything else (the similitude ⟹ equivariant-colouring identity, and similitude ⟹ cone-preserving)
is elementary linear algebra, proved below axiom-clean. So F4 lands its genuine content (the equivariance)
and names — rather than hides — the one classical carry it shares with A1. -/

/-- **A1 / F4's shared classical carry — a nondegenerate quadric determines its form up to a scalar
(the EXACT, correctly-scoped classical theorem, carried as a citation).** For `p` odd and `d ≥ 4`: any
two quadratic forms `Q`, `R` on `𝔽_p^d` with `Q` nondegenerate and the **same isotropic cone**
(`Q v = 0 ↔ R v = 0`) satisfy `R = μ·Q` for a nonzero scalar `μ`. Equivalently, the degree-2 forms
vanishing on the quadric `Q = 0` are exactly `⟨Q⟩` (`vanishDim = 1`); equivalently, the vanishing ideal
of a nondegenerate quadric is principal.

**Citation, not a Lean proof.** This is classical finite geometry (Hirschfeld, *Projective Geometries
over Finite Fields*, quadrics chapter; the projective Nullstellensatz for a nondegenerate quadric).
Mathlib has no quadric zero-locus result, so — following the project discipline for cited results
(`Theorem41Statement`, `PrimitiveCCClassification`) — it is carried as a **named premise** threaded to
the capstone, NOT proved here.

**The scope is load-bearing and makes it EXACTLY TRUE (not a vacuity trap).** The unrestricted `∀ Q R`
form is FALSE: at `d = 3, q = 3` a nondegenerate conic has only `q+1 = 4` points, which lie on a pencil
of conics (`vanishDim = 2`). The hypotheses `p ≠ 2`, `4 ≤ d`, `Q.polarBilin.Nondegenerate` are exactly
the range where it holds — probe-confirmed `vanishDim = 1` for `d = 4,6,8`, `q = 3,5,7,11`
(`route_c_reconstruct_probe.py`), and covering all affine-polar `VO^ε_{2m}` (`m ≥ 2`). The bounds are
built into the statement as antecedents so a `p = 2` / `d < 4` instance is (correctly) vacuous. -/

/-! ## F2 — the `q = pᵉ` semilinear (Frobenius / ΓL) seam

For `q = p` (prime) the whole spine above works over `ZMod p` because the additive structure F1 recovers
*is* the `𝔽_p`-vector space. For `q = pᵉ` (`e > 1`) the vertex set is `𝔽_q^d`, and the crucial new fact is
that a graph isomorphism between two `𝔽_q`-affine-polar graphs is only `𝔽_p`-**semilinear**: by the
fundamental theorem of projective geometry its linear part is `g = M ∘ σ̂`, where `M` is `𝔽_q`-linear and
`σ̂` is the coordinate-wise action of a field automorphism `σ ∈ Gal(𝔽_q/𝔽_p)` (the "Γ" in `AΓO`). So the
recovered form transports up to a scalar **and** a field automorphism: `Q'(g u − g t) = μ · σ(Q(u − t))`.
This section proves that equivariance identity (the semilinear analog of F4), field-generically over `K`.
The recovery of the `𝔽_q`-structure itself is subsumed by the geometric coordinatization (§7a / R1 —
Buekenhout–Shult recovers the projective space *over `𝔽_q`*, field included). -/

Frobenius twist).** Given the linear part `g` of a graph isomorphism between two `𝔽_q`-affine-polar
graphs (bijective, cone-preserving), nondegenerate `Q`, and the cited fundamental-theorem fact `hcite`,
the recovered difference colouring transports with a global scalar `μ` **and** a field automorphism `σ`:
`Q'(g u − g t) = μ · σ(Q(u − t))`. This is F4 for `q = pᵉ`: canonicalizing via the recovered form is
iso-invariant even in the presence of field twists (`AΓO` vs `AGO`). The `q = p` prime case
(`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant`) is the `σ = id` specialization. Axiom-clean; the only
non-elementary input is `hcite`, threaded like `Theorem41Statement`. -/
