# Full correctness of the graph canonizer — umbrella + proof plan

Re-exports all submodules under `FullCorrectness/`. External consumers can
`import FullCorrectness` to pull in the whole proof; internal modules import
the specific step(s) they depend on.

The flat-flawed proof in `LeanGraphCanonizerV4Correctness.lean` is retired — its header
explains why its central equivariance claim is literally false. This tree replaces it.

## Target theorem (to be proved in §8)

```
run_canonical : G ≃ H ↔ run (Array.replicate n 0) G = run (Array.replicate n 0) H
```

"`run` with all-zero starting vertex types is a complete graph-isomorphism invariant."

## Open obligations (2 sorry sites)

| Sorry | Location | What's needed |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- |
| `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq`             | `Tiebreak`                         | **Net-new infrastructure**, NOT mechanical chaining of existing Stages A–D. See "Stage B/D gap" below. |

**`Invariants.lean` and `Equivariance.PathEquivariance.lean` are both fully closed.**
`orderVertices_prefix_invariant`, `orderVertices_n_distinct_ranks`,
`calculatePathRankings_fromRanks_inv`, and `calculatePathRankings_betweenRanks_inv` are all
proved unconditionally.

## The Stage B/D gap blocking `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq`

The original plan billed `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` as "mechanical given Stages A–D." On
inspection that is **not accurate**: the existing Stages A–D are stated in *fixed-point*
form (single σ-INVARIANT array applied to the same/permuted graph), but
`runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` needs *relational* equivariance — TWO τ-related arrays
`arr₁, arr₂` (with `arr₂[w] = arr₁[τ⁻¹ w]`) feeding the same `G`, where neither array
is τ-fixed.

What the proven Stages give vs. what the runFrom proof needs:

| Stage | Proven form                                                                                                       | Needed (relational) form                                                                                          |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A     | General σ: `initializePaths (G.permute σ) = PathState.permute σ (initializePaths G)`                              | (already general — reusable as-is)                                                                                |
| B     | σ ∈ Aut G **AND** σ-INV vts ⟹ `RankState.permute σ rs = rs` (σ-fixed point)                                       | σ ∈ Aut G, ANY vts: `calculatePathRankings (init G) (σ·vts) = RankState.permute σ (calculatePathRankings (init G) vts)` |
| C     | σ-INV form: `convergeLoop` preserves σ-INVARIANCE of a single array                                               | σ-related form: τ-related arrays produce τ-related convergeLoop outputs                                            |
| D     | `labelEdges vts (G.permute σ) = labelEdges vts G` for σ ∈ Aut G (same vts on permuted graph)                      | `labelEdges (σ·rks) G = labelEdges rks G` for σ ∈ Aut G AND tie-free rks (different rks on same graph)             |

The σ-cell-INV proof in `Equivariance.PathEquivariance` rests crucially on
`comparePathsFrom_σ_self_eq` which requires σ-INV vts (so that `cmp p (σ·p) = .eq`).
Lifting Stage B to the relational form requires redoing the foldl-induction body in a
relational form (~few hundred lines, comparable to the σ-cell-INV proof itself).

Stage D-rel is even less direct: the `denseRanks` step uses `(rank, vertex-index)`
lexicographic order. Under τ-relabeling, the secondary key `vertex-index` gets
τ-permuted, so the dense-ranks-as-permutation argument requires either tie-freeness
of `rks` at this step, or a structural theorem about `labelEdgesAccordingToRankings`
that factors through the inverse of `denseRanks`.

### Three reasonable resolutions

1. **Build the relational stages.** Mirror the σ-cell-INV machinery in relational form
   (Stage B-rel, C-rel) plus a structure theorem for `labelEdges` (Stage D-rel). Estimate:
   500–1000 lines, comparable to the work that closed `calculatePathRankings_*_inv`.
2. **Find a different proof of `run_isomorphic_eq_new`** that bypasses
   `tiebreak_choice_independent` entirely. If successful, both sorries close together
   without going through the gap. Risky — current sketch uses §6 essentially.
3. **Acknowledge `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` as the entry point** for canonicalization
   correctness and accept it as a "deep" lemma requiring net-new work; do not pretend it
   is downstream of the existing Stages.

The plan was to attempt path 2 first (cheaper if it works), falling back to
path 1 when no alternative proof shape presented itself.

### Refactor of Stage B (σ-INV form) — landed

Before lifting Stage B to relational form, the 2609-line `Equivariance/PathEquivariance.lean`
has been split into 5 modular files (1–2 logical concerns each). All sub-lemmas the
σ-INV proof depends on are now in dedicated modules:

| File | Lines | Content |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| `Equivariance/CompareEquivariant.lean`           | 523 | σ-equivariance of `comparePathSegments`/`...PathsBetween`/`...PathsFrom`; `PathsBetween_permute_connectedSubPaths_perm`, `PathsFrom_permute_pathsToVertex_perm`; bridge helpers (`betweenRankFn_σ_inv_from_cells`, `initializePaths_σInv_via_Aut`). |
| `Equivariance/PathsAtDepthStructure.lean`        | 231 | `initializePaths_pathsAtDepth_structure`, `initializePaths_pathsAtDepth_inner_structure`, `initializePaths_allBetween_pairs_facts`. |
| `Equivariance/ChainSetInvariant.lean`            | 693 | 1D and 2D chain σ-invariance preservation: `set_chain_σInvariant`, `setBetween_chain_σInvariant` and their size-preservation helpers. |
| `Equivariance/AssignListRankClosure.lean`        | 835 | σ-self-equality of compare functions; σ-rank-closure of `assignList` (`from_assignList_σ_rank_closure`, `between_assignList_σ_rank_closure`). |
| `Equivariance/PathEquivariance.lean`             | 401 | Stage B assembly only: `CalcRankingsInv`, body step, foldl induction, `calculatePathRankings_Aut_equivariant`. |

### Stage B-rel (relational form) — foundational lemmas all proved

A new module `Equivariance/PathEquivarianceRelational.lean` (~1500 lines) contains the
relational analogues of the foundational lemmas, plus auxiliary additions to
`ComparisonSort.lean`. **Status: all foundational pieces closed; only the body-step
and final Stage B-rel assembly remain.**

| Component | Status |
| --------- | ------ |
| `comparePathSegments_σ_relational`                                     | ✅ proved |
| `comparePathsBetween_σ_relational`                                     | ✅ proved |
| `comparePathsFrom_σ_relational`                                        | ✅ proved |
| `sortBy_map_pointwise_relational`                                      | ✅ proved |
| `orderInsensitiveListCmp_map_pointwise_relational`                     | ✅ proved |
| `set_chain_σRelated`                                                   | ✅ proved |
| `setBetween_chain_σRelated`                                            | ✅ proved |
| `assignRanks_map_relational` (in `ComparisonSort.lean`)                | ✅ proved (relational lift of `assignRanks_map_of_cmp_respect`) |
| `assignRanks_rank_succ_when_cmp_neq_eq` (in `ComparisonSort.lean`)     | ✅ proved (dual of `assignRanks_rank_eq_at_succ_when_cmp_eq` for the `.lt`-step case) |
| `assignRanks_rank_eq_of_sorted_perm` (in `ComparisonSort.lean`)        | ✅ proved (rank at each position is the same for sorted Perm-equivalent inputs; the missing technical gap from the previous status) |
| `pathsAtDepth_map_f_perm`                                              | ✅ proved (via `map_reindex_perm` + state σ-fixedness) |
| `allBetween_map_f_perm`                                                | ✅ proved (via `flatMap_eq_foldl` + `Perm.flatMap_left` + `pathsAtDepth_map_f_perm`) |
| `from_assignList_σ_rank_rel`                                           | ✅ proved |
| `between_assignList_σ_rank_rel`                                        | ✅ proved |
| Body step + foldl induction + `Stage B-rel` assembly                   | 🟦 not yet started |

With both relational σ-rank-closure lemmas closed, the remaining work is to assemble:
1. A relational body step (parallel to `calculatePathRankings_body_preserves_inv` in
   `PathEquivariance.lean`) that uses `set_chain_σRelated` / `setBetween_chain_σRelated`
   with the σ-rank-rel lemmas as the σ-closure hypotheses.
2. A foldl induction over `List.range n` (parallel to `calculatePathRankings_σ_cell_inv_facts`).
3. The final `calculatePathRankings_σ_equivariant_relational` assembly.

This is mechanical given the foundational lemmas above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plan of attack: closing the two open sorries

**Goal**: close `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` (Tiebreak.lean) and `run_isomorphic_eq_new` (Main.lean).

**Dependency graph**:

```
Main.run_isomorphic_eq_new (⟹ direction of run_canonical)
  ↓ uses
Tiebreak.runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq
  ↓ uses
[Stage B-rel] + [Stage C-rel] + [Stage D-rel] + [breakTie/tiebreak handling]
```

Six phases, ordered by risk and dependency. Phase 1 is purely mechanical assembly;
phases 2 and 4 are direct applications; phases 3, 5, 6 each have one technical wrinkle.

### Phase 1 — Stage B-rel assembly (~300 lines)

**File**: `Equivariance/PathEquivarianceRelational.lean` (extend).

Mirror what `PathEquivariance.lean` does for the σ-INV form, with our new relational
foundational lemmas:

```
private def CalcRankingsRel σ acc₁ acc₂ : Prop  -- relational invariant: sizes + cell σ-related
private theorem calculatePathRankings_body_preserves_rel  -- body step (uses set_chain_σRelated, setBetween_chain_σRelated, from/between_assignList_σ_rank_rel)
private theorem calculatePathRankings_σ_cell_rel_facts    -- foldl induction over List.range n
theorem calculatePathRankings_σ_equivariant_relational    -- Stage B-rel (final)
```

All foundational lemmas (`set_chain_σRelated`, `setBetween_chain_σRelated`,
`from_assignList_σ_rank_rel`, `between_assignList_σ_rank_rel`) are in place.
**Risk: low.** Mechanical assembly.

### Phase 2 — Stage C-rel: `convergeLoop` τ-equivariance (~150 lines)

**File**: New `Equivariance/ConvergeLoopRelational.lean`, or extend `ConvergeLoop.lean`.

```
convergeOnce_VtsInvariant_eq:
  τ ∈ G.Aut → arr-sizes-n → τ-related arr₁, arr₂ →
  ∀ w, (convergeOnce state arr₂).1.getD w 0 = (convergeOnce state arr₁).1.getD (τ⁻¹ w) 0

convergeLoop_VtsInvariant_eq:
  ... ∀ fuel, ∀ w, ...
```

Direct application of Stage B-rel via `convergeOnce_writeback`: convergeOnce writes
`getFrom (n-1) w` from `calculatePathRankings`. Stage B-rel gives the τ-relation on
`getFrom`. **Risk: low.** Short, parallel to existing `convergeOnce_Aut_invariant`.

### Phase 3 — Stage D-rel under tie-freeness (~250 lines)

**File**: New `Equivariance/StageDRelational.lean`.

```
labelEdges_VtsInvariant_eq_distinct:
  τ ∈ G.Aut →
  rks₁, rks₂ τ-related, both with all-distinct ranks →
  labelEdgesAccordingToRankings rks₂ G = labelEdgesAccordingToRankings rks₁ G
```

The technical wrinkle: `computeDenseRanks` uses `(rank, vertex-index)` lex order. Under
τ-relabeling, the secondary `vertex-index` key gets τ-permuted. Tie-freeness of `rks`
collapses the secondary key (no ties to break), so dense ranks are determined by
primary rank alone, hence τ-related. Combined with `τ ∈ Aut G`, the resulting
adjacency matrices match position-by-position.

Sub-lemmas:
- `computeDenseRanks_VtsInvariant_eq_distinct`: dense ranks τ-related.
- `sortBy_lex_VtsInvariant_distinct`: sort permutation in arr₂ is τ-conjugate of arr₁'s.
- Final adjacency-matrix equality via Aut.

**Risk: medium.** The dense-ranks-under-τ argument is intricate but well-defined.

### Phase 4 — breakTie / shiftAbove τ-related preservation helpers (~150 lines)

**Critical observation**: `breakTie` is **not** in general τ-equivariant — its "smallest
index" choice depends on `Fin` ordering, which τ does not respect. So we collect helpers
for the parts that *do* preserve τ-relatedness:

```
shiftAbove_VtsInvariant_eq:
  τ-related arr₁, arr₂ → (shiftAbove t arr₂)[w] = (shiftAbove t arr₁)[τ⁻¹ w]

breakTieAt_τ_related:  -- generalize the existing breakTieAt_VtsInvariant_eq
  (already exists for σ ∈ TypedAut on a single vts; lift to τ ∈ Aut G + τ-related arrs)
```

**Risk: low.** Direct, parallel to existing helpers in `Tiebreak.lean`.

### Phase 5 — `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` main proof (~300 lines)

**Strategy**: Joint induction on `(n - start)` with `tiebreak_choice_independent`.

**Why joint induction?** breakTie's choice can DIVERGE between τ-related inputs
(min-index doesn't commute with τ). The standard chained-Stages proof breaks here.
Resolution: state and prove `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` and `tiebreak_choice_independent`
*together* by induction on `(n - start)`, sharing a single IH that absorbs both:
1. τ-related arrays produce equal final matrices.
2. Different tiebreak choices in the same orbit produce equal final matrices.

**Base case** (`n - start = 0`): foldl is empty; orderedRanks_i = arr_i. After the full
`runFrom 0 arr G` loop, ranks are distinct (`orderVertices_n_distinct_ranks`) — so
Stage D-rel applies. For the inductive descent into `runFrom (start+1) ...`, the
arr_i may not yet be distinct, but successive convergeLoop+breakTie iterations make
them so by the time the loop exits.

**Inductive step**: ct₁ := convergeLoop arr₁; ct₂ := convergeLoop arr₂. By Stage C-rel,
ct₁, ct₂ τ-related. The two breakTie choices keep₁, keep₂ may differ:
- If keep₂ = τ keep₁: arr₁', arr₂' τ-related (via `breakTieAt_τ_related`); apply IH.
- Else: introduce alternative arr₂_alt := breakTieAt ct₂ start (τ keep₁). By IH-on-
  `tiebreak_choice_independent`, runFrom on arr₂' equals runFrom on arr₂_alt. Then
  arr₁' and arr₂_alt are τ-related; apply IH-on-`runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq`.

**Risk: high.** The joint induction is intricate; getting the IH form right takes care.

### Phase 6 — `Main.run_isomorphic_eq_new` (~150 lines)

Given `G ≃ H`. By §2 obtain σ with `H = G.permute σ`. Goal: `run 0 G = run 0 H`.

**Decomposition**:
- `run vts G = labelEdges (orderVertices (initializePaths G) (getArrayRank vts)) G`.
- For `vts = zeros`, `getArrayRank zeros = zeros`.
- By Stage A: `initializePaths H = (initializePaths G).permute σ`.
- For σ ∈ Aut G: trivial reduction to identity.
- For σ ∉ Aut G: harder — H differs from G structurally.

**Resolution path**: do *not* case-split on σ ∈ Aut G. Use a stronger generic
σ-equivariance for the pre-labelEdges pipeline (Stages A, B-rel, C-rel are all
generic for any σ : `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` consistently applied to `(state, vts)`).
The argument:
1. `orderVertices (initializePaths H) zeros` is the σ-image of
   `orderVertices (initializePaths G) zeros` (modulo tiebreak choices, absorbed via Phase 5).
2. By Stage D-rel applied to σ acting from G to H: `labelEdges ... H = labelEdges ... G`.

The Stage D-rel here is slightly more general than Phase 3 (σ may not be ∈ Aut G), but
since `H = G.permute σ`, applying it to `(G, σ)` and then transporting through
`G = (G.permute σ).permute σ⁻¹` gives the equality.

**Risk: medium-high.** The exact σ-equivariance form needed at the labelEdges step
may require generalization beyond Phase 3.

### Risks and ordering

| Phase | Description | Risk | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stage B-rel assembly                            | low         | ~300  |
| 2 | Stage C-rel                                     | low         | ~150  |
| 4 | breakTie / shiftAbove helpers                   | low         | ~150  |
| 3 | Stage D-rel under tie-freeness                  | medium      | ~250  |
| 5 | `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` (joint induction)     | high        | ~300  |
| 6 | `Main.run_isomorphic_eq_new`                    | medium-high | ~150  |

**Total: ~1300–1500 new lines.** Recommended order: 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 5 → 6. Phases 1, 2,
4 are independent enough to swap if useful. Phase 3 should land before Phase 5 since
Phase 5's base case appeals to Stage D-rel.

Possible risk-mitigation pivots:
- If Phase 5's joint induction proves too complex, fall back to: split on whether
  ranks are already distinct (skip breakTie) vs. not (recurse).
- If Phase 6 needs a stronger σ-equivariance than Phase 3 provides, prove the
  generalized form first, then specialize back to Phase 3 as a corollary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## §1  Automorphism group, vertex orbits, and permutation action

**Status: proved.** Definitions and theorems live in `Basic`, `Permutation`, `Automorphism`.

### §1.1  Permutation action on `AdjMatrix` (`Permutation.lean`)

`AdjMatrix.permute σ G` relabels the vertices of `G` by `σ`, using `σ.symm` so that
composition is a left action: `G.permute (σ * τ) = (G.permute τ).permute σ`.

Proved:
- `permute_one`                  — `G.permute 1 = G`
- `permute_mul`                  — left-action composition law
- `permute_permute_symm`         — `(G.permute σ).permute σ⁻¹ = G` (round-trip)
- `permute_symm_permute`         — `(G.permute σ⁻¹).permute σ = G`

### §1.2  Bridge to `swapVertexLabels` (`Permutation.lean`)

`swapVertexLabels_eq_permute : swapVertexLabels v1 v2 G = G.permute (Equiv.swap v1 v2)`

Connects the inductive `Isomorphic` generator to the abstract permutation action.
`Equiv.swap v1 v2` is self-inverse (`toFun = invFun` definitionally), which is why
`.symm` reduces by `rfl` here.

### §1.3  Automorphism subgroup (`Automorphism.lean`)

`AdjMatrix.Aut G : Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` — permutations σ with `G.permute σ = G`.

Proved using `permute_one` / `permute_mul` / `permute_permute_symm` for the three
subgroup axioms. Also `mem_Aut_iff_adj` for the pointwise characterization.

### §1.4–§1.6  Orbits and partition (`Automorphism.lean`)

`AdjMatrix.orbit G v := { w | ∃ σ ∈ Aut G, σ v = w }`

`AdjMatrix.orbitSetoid G : Setoid (Fin n)` packages same-orbit as an equivalence relation
(reflexive via `1 ∈ Aut G`, symmetric via inverses, transitive via composition), so the
orbits partition `Fin n` by Lean's quotient infrastructure.

`orbit_stable_under_Aut` — the forward-facing form: `σ ∈ Aut G → σ v ∈ G.orbit v`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## §2  Bridge lemma: `Isomorphic ↔ ∃ σ, H = G.permute σ`

**Status: proved** in `Isomorphic.lean`.

```
permute_of_Isomorphic        : G ≃ H → ∃ σ, H = G.permute σ
Isomorphic_of_permute        : H = G.permute σ → G ≃ H
Isomorphic_iff_exists_permute: G ≃ H ↔ ∃ σ, H = G.permute σ
```

(⟹) is induction on the `Isomorphic` constructors using `permute_one`,
`swapVertexLabels_eq_permute`, and `permute_mul` (composition order σ₂ * σ₁ in the
`trans` case is forced by the left-action law). (⟸) is `Equiv.Perm.swap_induction_on`
followed by `permute_mul` + `swapVertexLabels_eq_permute` to fold each transposition
back into an `Isomorphic.swap`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## §3  Pipeline equivariance under Aut(G)

**Goal.** For any σ ∈ `Aut G` and any vertex-type array `vts`, the canonizer pipeline
applied to the σ-permuted graph with σ-permuted types produces the σ-permuted output.

Crucially this is quantified over `σ ∈ Aut G`, **not** all of `Sym(Fin n)`. The old flat
proof quantified over all of `Sym(Fin n)`, which is false because `breakTie` is not
equivariant under arbitrary label permutations (only under automorphisms).

**Stage A — `initializePaths`.**
```
σ ∈ Aut G  →  paths in `swapVL-via-σ G` at (d, s, e)
              correspond to paths in G at (d, σ⁻¹ s, σ⁻¹ e)
```
with edge types, vertex indices, and nested `PathSegment` structures all relabeled by σ.
Proof by induction on depth; the action on `PathSegment`/`PathsBetween`/`PathsFrom` lifts
componentwise from the Fin-level action.

**Stage B — `calculatePathRankings`.** If the input `PathState` and `vertexTypes` are
σ-related, then the output ranks satisfy
```
ranks'.betweenRanks[d][s][e] = ranks.betweenRanks[d][σ⁻¹ s][σ⁻¹ e],
ranks'.fromRanks[d][s]       = ranks.fromRanks[d][σ⁻¹ s].
```
Proof by induction on depth, using that `comparePathSegments` / `comparePathsBetween` /
`comparePathsFrom` only depend on σ-invariant features (edge types and endpoint vertex
types are preserved because σ ∈ Aut G; the recursive rank references are equivariant by IH).

**Stage C — `orderVertices`.** `convergeOnce` reads `fromRanks` (equivariant by Stage B),
so it preserves the relation. `breakTie` is the interesting case — it is equivariant under
`Aut(G)` (not under `Sym(Fin n)`) *at each outer-loop iteration*, because the vertices it
chooses between are all in the same Aut(G)-orbit. See §6 for why the *choice* of which
tied vertex to promote doesn't affect the final answer.

**Stage D — `labelEdgesAccordingToRankings`.** With distinct ranks (§7), the vertex at
position p in the σ-permuted sort is σ applied to the vertex at position p in the original.
The edge at (p, q) is then `(σ·G).adj(σwₚ)(σwₙ) = G.adj wₚ wₙ` by the Aut(G) property.

**Deliverable.** Four equivariance theorems in `FullCorrectness/Equivariance.lean`:
```
initializePaths_Aut_equivariant      : σ ∈ Aut G → ...  (Stage A)
calculatePathRankings_Aut_equivariant: σ ∈ Aut G → ...  (Stage B)
orderVertices_Aut_equivariant        : σ ∈ Aut G → ...  (Stage C, modulo §6)
labelEdges_Aut_equivariant           : σ ∈ Aut G → ...  (Stage D, given §7)
```

## §4  `convergeLoop` output is Aut(G)-invariant

**Goal.**
```
σ ∈ Aut G  ∧  (∀ v, vts[σ v] = vts[v])  →  ∀ v, (convergeLoop state vts fuel)[σ v]
                                                  = (convergeLoop state vts fuel)[v]
```
i.e. if the input vertex types are Aut(G)-invariant, so is the output.

**Why.** `convergeOnce` writes `rankState.getFrom (n-1) v` into slot `v`. That value
depends only on paths-from-v; any σ ∈ Aut G bijects paths-from-v with paths-from-(σv)
preserving edge types and endpoint types (the endpoint types are Aut-invariant by the IH
on vertex-types). So the multisets fed into `comparePathsFrom` are identical, the ranks
are identical, and Aut-invariance is preserved. Induct on the fuel parameter.

**Corollary.** Starting from the all-zeros array (which is trivially Aut-invariant), after
`convergeLoop`, vertices in the same Aut(G)-orbit carry the same type.

**Deliverable.** One theorem in `FullCorrectness/Equivariance.lean`:
```
convergeLoop_Aut_invariant : σ ∈ Aut G → vts σ-invariant → convergeLoop output σ-invariant
```

## §5  `breakTie` shrinks the typed-automorphism group

Let `Aut(G, T)` := `{ σ ∈ Aut G | σ permutes T as a bijection on equal values }` be the
automorphisms preserving a given typing T. This is a subgroup of `Aut G`.

**Goal.** Let T be Aut(G)-invariant, let t₀ be the smallest value held by at least two
vertices, let V_{t₀} be its type-class, let v* := min V_{t₀} (by Fin order), and let
T' := `breakTie T t₀` (which promotes every vertex in V_{t₀} except v*). Then
```
Aut(G, T')  =  { σ ∈ Aut(G, T) | σ v* = v* }                         (stabilizer of v*)
```

**Why.** σ ∈ Aut(G, T') iff σ preserves T' iff σ sends the unique type-t₀ vertex (v*) to
itself and sends V_{t₀} \ {v*} to itself. The first condition forces σ v* = v*; the second
is then automatic given σ ∈ Aut(G, T).

**Strict shrinking.** If some τ ∈ Aut(G, T) moves v* (the `hmove` hypothesis below), then
that τ is in `TypedAut G T` but not in the v*-stabilizer, so the stabilizer is a proper
subgroup. After each tiebreak, the typed-automorphism group strictly shrinks; after at
most n tiebreaks it is trivial (all types distinct).

**Deliverable.** Both theorems are proved in `FullCorrectness/Tiebreak.lean`:
```
breakTie_Aut_stabilizer  : [with hsize + hAutInv]
    σ ∈ TypedAut G (breakTie vts t₀).1  ↔  (σ ∈ TypedAut G vts ∧ σ v* = v*)
breakTie_TypedAut_le     : TypedAut G (breakTie vts t₀).1 ≤ TypedAut G vts
breakTie_strict_shrink   : [with hmove] TypedAut G (breakTie vts t₀).1 < TypedAut G vts
```

Four position-by-position characterization lemmas underpin the proofs:
```
breakTie_size             : (breakTie vts t₀).1.size = vts.size
breakTie_getD_below       : vts[j] < t₀ → (breakTie vts t₀).1[j] = vts[j]
breakTie_getD_above       : vts[j] > t₀ → (breakTie vts t₀).1[j] = vts[j] + 1   -- when fired
breakTie_getD_at_min      : v_star is min of typeClass → (breakTie vts t₀).1[v_star] = t₀
breakTie_getD_at_other    : w ≠ v_star in typeClass → (breakTie vts t₀).1[w] = t₀ + 1
```
The split into `_below` / `_above` (rather than a single `_of_ne`) reflects the
shift-then-promote design forced by dense ranks (see the `breakTie` docstring in
[LeanGraphCanonizerV4.lean](LeanGraphCanonizerV4.lean)).

Two reusable corollaries support §7's `breakTie_targetPos_is_min_tied`:
```
breakTie_getD_target     : vts[w] = t₀ → output[w] = t₀ ∨ output[w] = t₀ + 1
breakTie_getD_target_ge  : vts[w] = t₀ → t₀ ≤ output[w]
```
Both pick `v_star` as the smallest target-valued index (`Nat.find`) and apply
`breakTie_getD_at_min` / `breakTie_getD_at_other`.

### Hypotheses beyond the original sketch

  1. **§5.1 carries `hsize : vts.size = n` and `hAutInv : ∀ σ ∈ G.Aut, VtsInvariant σ vts`.**
     The Aut-invariance is genuinely necessary: without it, a label swap between a
     non-`v*` member of `typeClass t₀` and some position carrying value `t₀ + 1` can
     preserve `vts'` (both get value `t₀+1`) without preserving `vts`. Aut-invariance
     rules out this counterexample, and is satisfied at every `breakTie` call by §4's
     corollary.

  2. **§5.2 carries `hmove : ∃ σ ∈ G.TypedAut vts, σ v_star ≠ v_star`.**
     The plan's sketch derived strict shrinking from "same-type vertices lie in a single
     Aut-orbit" (§4's corollary), but §4 only gives the forward direction (same-orbit →
     same-type). The reverse is essentially the algorithm's completeness and is captured
     here as the minimal needed input.

## §6  Tiebreak choice-independence (the conceptual crux)

This is the step the old flat proof did not need — because it assumed `breakTie` never
fires — and the reason the flat proof fails once tiebreaks are real.

**Goal.** Let T be Aut(G)-invariant. Let t₀ be the smallest repeated value, and let v₁, v₂
be any two vertices in V_{t₀} (so by §4 they are in the same Aut(G, T)-orbit). Let T₁ / T₂
be the result of promoting v₁ / v₂ respectively. Then
```
 Run the remainder of the canonizer pipeline (including all subsequent tiebreaks and the
 final relabel) starting from (G, T₁) vs. (G, T₂). The **final canonical matrices are equal.**
```

**Why.** Let τ ∈ Aut(G, T) with τ v₁ = v₂ (exists by same-orbit). Then the pair (G, T₂)
equals τ · (G, T₁) in the sense that G is τ-invariant (τ ∈ Aut G) and T₂ = τ · T₁ (the
promoted-type array, permuted by τ, matches the other choice). By Aut(G)-equivariance of
the remaining pipeline (§3), running on τ · (G, T₁) produces τ · (final output). But the
final output has all types distinct, so the relabel step in §8 sorts τ away, producing the
same canonical matrix.

### Reduction to a single pipeline-equivariance lemma

`tiebreak_choice_independent` carries two extra hypotheses beyond the plan sketch:
  - `hsize : vts.size = n` — trivially satisfied by the algorithm.
  - `hconn : ∃ τ ∈ G.TypedAut vts, τ v₁ = v₂` — orbit connectivity. Same "same-type ⟹
    same-orbit" requirement that §5.2 needed, surfaced explicitly because §4 only gives
    the forward direction.

With those hypotheses, §6 reduces to the *pipeline equivariance* statement:

```
runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq :
  τ ∈ G.Aut → (∀ w, arr₂[w] = arr₁[τ⁻¹ w]) → runFrom s arr₁ G = runFrom s arr₂ G
```

which is §3 (Stages B–D) chained. **`tiebreak_choice_independent` type-checks** by
discharging via `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` applied to the τ-related pair `breakTieAt vts t₀
v₁`, `breakTieAt vts t₀ v₂` (related by the τ from `hconn`). The single open obligation in
this whole chain is `runFrom_VtsInvariant_eq` itself.

Supporting deliverables in `Tiebreak.lean`:
```
breakTieAt_size             : (breakTieAt vts t₀ keep).size = vts.size
breakTieAt_getD_of_ne       : vts[j] ≠ t₀ → (breakTieAt vts t₀ keep)[j] = vts[j]
breakTieAt_getD_keep        : (breakTieAt vts t₀ keep)[keep] = vts[keep]
breakTieAt_getD_promoted    : w ≠ keep ∧ vts[w] = t₀ → (breakTieAt vts t₀ keep)[w] = t₀ + 1
breakTieAt_VtsInvariant_eq  : [τ-equivariance under VtsInvariant τ vts]
```

## §7  "Converged types are a prefix of ℕ" invariant

`orderVertices` calls `breakTie convergedTypes targetPosition` where `targetPosition`
is the outer-loop counter `0, 1, …, n-1`, NOT the smallest tied value. For §5/§6 to
apply, we need: at iteration p, the smallest tied value is exactly p.

**Goal.**
```
∀ p ≤ n, after p outer iterations, the typing takes values exactly in {0, 1, …, p-1, k}
         where k is either the next tied value (= p, if one exists) or n (if all distinct).
```

**Why.** Initial types from `convergeLoop` form a prefix-of-ℕ ranking (this follows from
`assignRanks`, which assigns the index of the first element in each equivalence class;
the dense-rank pipeline keeps values exactly 0..m-1). Each `breakTie` with target p leaves
values 0..p-1 unchanged and promotes some value-p vertices to p+1, which the next
`convergeLoop` re-densifies.

```

The `orderVertices_prefix_invariant` proof factors into three phases:

- **Phase 1 — inductive skeleton** (✅): Strengthened invariant (`_strong` form) tracks
  both the prefix-typing property and the uniqueness `0..q-1`. Induction on `q` from `0`
  to `p`. The base case is vacuous. The step uses Phase 3 (convergeLoop preservation)
  followed by Phase 2 (breakTie step).

- **Phase 2 — breakTie step** (✅ as `breakTie_step_preserves_uniqueness`): For `T`
  prefix with `0..q-1` uniquely held and `q < n`, `(breakTie T q).1` is prefix and has
  `0..q` uniquely held. Cases on `breakTieCount T q < 2` (noop) or `≥ 2` (fires).
  Uses `breakTie_getD_below`, `breakTie_getD_at_min`, `breakTie_getD_at_other`,
  `breakTie_getD_above_or`, plus a converse to `breakTieCount_ge_two_of_distinct`
  (`exists_two_distinct_q_in_T`, derived from `List.Duplicate` + `List.Sublist`).

- **Phase 3 — convergeLoop preservation** (🧱 single sorry, with sub-sub-lemmas being
  built): For `T` prefix with `0..q-1` uniquely held by `v_0..v_{q-1}` (with `T[v_k] = k`),
  `convergeLoop _ T fuel` has the same property. The proof uses three weaker facts about
  `T' = convergeOnce T`: (a) `T'[v_k] < q` for unique-typed `v_k`, (b) `T'[w] ≥ q` for
  non-unique-typed `w`, (c) `k ↦ T'[v_k]` is injective. Then `{T'[v_k] | k < q} = {0..q-1}`
  and the public `∃!` follows.

  Sub-sub-lemmas:
  - **P3.1** ✅ `comparePathsFrom_eq_compare_of_start_types_ne` (different start types ⟹
    `comparePathsFrom` returns the comparison directly).
  - **P3.B** ✅ `assignRanks_rank_le_pos` (rank at position `k` is `≤ k`). Foundational.
    Uses aux lemmas `assignRanksFoldl_lastEntry_rank_le` (lastEntry rank tracks step count)
    and `assignRanks_snoc_decompose` (snoc-decomposition with rank bound).

    consecutive cmps differ). Built on `assignRanks_strong_invariant` which simultaneously
    tracks (i) rank-at-every-position and (ii) lastEntry-rank, via `reverseRecOn`
    induction. Uses `assignRanks_snoc_decompose_strict` (sharper snoc-decomposition with
    exact rank formula) and `assignRanks_foldl_lastEntry_fst` (lastEntry's first
    component).
  - **P3.D** ✅ `sortBy_first_q_positions_have_start_types`: closed this session.
    For `T` uniquely-typed at `0..q-1`, the first `q` positions of

    Strategy: strong induction on position `k`, with two sub-arguments:
    (A) `V_k ≥ k` — uses uniqueness + nodup of starts in sortedList: any value `j < k`
    that V_k could take would force its start to coincide with the unique witness at
    position `j` (where `V_j = j` by IH), contradicting nodup.
    (B) `V_k ≤ k` — find the unique witness `w_k` for value `k`; locate its position
    `pos` in sortedList; trichotomy on `pos` vs `k` gives a contradiction in each case
    (`pos < k` contradicts IH, `pos = k` gives `V_k = k`, `pos > k` violates Pairwise
    via P3.1 since `V_k > k = V_pos` would force `cmp = .gt`).

Closing `getFrom_image_isPrefix_for_initializePaths` (n ≥ 1) used these helpers:
- `inner_fold_slice_at_depth` (in `Equivariance.RankStateInvariants`) — strips the outer
  `fromAcc.set! depth` wrapper of the inner fold, reducing to a chain of `set!`s on the
  depth slice.
- `outer_fold_fromAcc_other_target_unchanged` (in `Invariants.lean`) — characterizes the
  outer depth loop: the `fromRanks` slot at any `target` is preserved as long as `target`
  is not in the list of remaining depths to process.
- `array_set_chain_outside_unchanged` / `array_set_chain_at_target_nodup` (in
  `Equivariance.RankStateInvariants`) — read out a `set!` chain at any target index when
  the chain's indices are `Nodup`. (Moved from `Invariants.lean` to share with
  `PathEquivariance.lean`'s σ-invariance proofs.)
- `initializePaths_pathsAtDepth_startVertices_eq_range` (in `Invariants.lean`) — for
  `state := initializePaths G`, the depth-`d` slice's `pathsFrom.startVertexIndex.val` list
  equals exactly `List.range n`.
- `chain_image_dense_of_perm_and_density` — generic image-density lemma: if the chain's
  indices are a permutation of `0..n-1` and the rank set is downward-closed, the image
  over `Fin n` is exactly `{0, …, m-1}` for some `m`.
- `chain_image_dense_for_assignRanks_sortBy` — wrapper specializing to the `assignRanks ⊕
  sortBy` form, deriving the perm/density conditions from `assignRanks_map_fst`,
  `sortBy_perm`, `assignRanks_image_dense`, and the start-vertex-list equality above.

`breakTie_targetPos_is_min_tied` proof sketch: assume by contradiction two distinct
vertices `w₁ ≠ w₂` share an output value `val ≤ p`. By `breakTie_getD_target`, target-valued
positions land on `{p, p+1}`; since `p+1 > p`, an output `≤ p` rules out promotion, so
`output[w_i] = vts[w_i]` (preserved). Two sub-cases on `val`:
- `val < p`: by the prefix-uniqueness hypothesis at `k := val`, `w₁ = w₂`. ⊥.
- `val = p`: only the smallest target-valued index keeps value `p` (others are promoted by
  `breakTie_getD_at_other`), so both `w_i` equal that index. ⊥.

## §8  Assembling `run_canonical`

With §1–§7 in hand:

**(→)** Given G ≃ H. By §2, there is σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) with H = G.permute σ. We want
`run 0 H = run 0 G`. Decompose the pipeline:

  1. `initializePaths` + `convergeLoop` + all iterations of `breakTie`/`convergeLoop` →
     some final typing T_G (for G) / T_H (for H).
  2. `labelEdgesAccordingToRankings T_G G` / `labelEdgesAccordingToRankings T_H H`.

The pipeline applied to H = G.permute σ with the all-zeros input is related by σ to the
pipeline applied to G. For the part of σ inside Aut G, this is §3 + §4 equivariance (T_H
is σ·T_G up to tiebreak choices, and §6 says those don't matter). For the part of σ outside
Aut G… there is no "outside" — σ takes G to G.permute σ = H, and H ≃ G, so this is just
restating that G, H are isomorphic. The canonical output depends on the abstract graph,
not the labeling.

**(←)** Given `run 0 G = run 0 H`. By `run_isomorphic_to_input` (proved in §4 of the flat
file, reused here), G ≃ run 0 G and H ≃ run 0 H. Chain:
```
G ≃ run 0 G = run 0 H ≃⁻¹ H   ⟹   G ≃ H.
```
This direction re-uses the genuinely-proved §4 lemma from the old flat file.

**Deliverable.** The capstone theorem in `FullCorrectness/Main.lean`:
```
theorem run_canonical : G ≃ H ↔ run (Array.replicate n 0) G = run (Array.replicate n 0) H
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Risks and open invariants

**R1.** §6 strong induction requires `|Aut(G, T)|` to be a well-founded measure. Trivial
with `Fintype`, but we need to actually put a `Fintype` instance on `Aut(G, T)` (it is a
subgroup of `Sym(Fin n)` which is finite). **Resolved:** `Fintype` instances on `Aut` and
`TypedAut` are in `Automorphism.lean` and `Tiebreak.lean`.

**R2.** §7's prefix-of-ℕ invariant assumes dense ranking throughout. **Resolved by the
sparse → dense ranking migration** (now landed in `LeanGraphCanonizerV4.lean`):
`assignRanks` produces dense ranks, `getArrayRank` densifies at the entry point, and
`breakTie` uses shift-then-promote (`shiftAbove` + `breakTiePromote`) to preserve density
across iterations. Re-verify `countUniqueCanonicals 4 == 11` and the literal-string
`#guard`s in `LeanGraphCanonizerV4Tests.lean` if the algorithm is touched again.

**R3.** `convergeLoop` is given fuel equal to `state.vertexCount`. Correctness does not
require it to actually reach a fixed point — §4 says the output is always Aut-invariant,
fixed point or not — but we should double-check that "output is Aut-invariant at every
iteration" is what induction gives us, not the weaker "fixed point is Aut-invariant."

**R4.** `Fin`/`Nat` bounds on `set!`, `getD`, and the array-index arithmetic throughout
will produce side conditions. Collect into a single `def` + lemmas file if they multiply.

## Suggested development order

Serial dependencies run §1 → §2 → §3 → §4 → (§5 ∥ §7) → §6 → §8. The independent
work (Mathlib-facing infrastructure: §1 done; §2 done) can proceed in parallel with
algorithm-facing work (§3–§5 are about the specific data structures of this canonizer).

§6 is the single hardest step and should be the budgeting focus once §3–§5 are in place.
