| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `POE` | 70-74 | Partial-order entries: the three values `less`, `unknown`, `greater` used to populate a `PMatrix`. | Inductive; `deriving DecidableEq, Repr` |
| `neg` | 87-91 | Antisymmetric reverse on a single `POE`: swaps `less` and `greater`, leaves `unknown` fixed. | — |
| `neg_neg` | 93-94 | `neg` is an involution: `neg (neg e) = e`. | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_less` | 103 | `POE.swap .less = .greater` (definitional unfolding of σ-swap). | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_greater` | 104 | `POE.swap .greater = .less` (definitional unfolding of σ-swap). | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_unknown` | 105 | `POE.swap .unknown = .unknown` (definitional unfolding of σ-swap). | `@[simp]` |
| `PMatrix` | 111-112 | The partial-order matrix type: `Fin n → Fin n → POE`. | Definition |
| `swap` | 118-119 | Pointwise σ-swap of a `PMatrix`: swap `less` with `greater` at every entry. | — |
| `swap_swap` | 121-122 | σ-swap is an involution on `PMatrix`: `swap (swap P) = P`. | `@[simp]` |
| `Antisymmetric` | 124-126 | A `PMatrix` is antisymmetric when `P i j = POE.neg (P j i)` for all `i, j`. | — |
| `AdjMatrix` | 135-136 | Locally-defined adjacency matrix on `Fin n`, wrapping a `Fin n → Fin n → Nat` field. | Structure |
| `applyGuess` | 140-147 | Apply a single guess `(a, b, dir)` to `P`: set `P a b := dir` and `P b a := neg dir`, leaving every other entry unchanged. Does not transitively close. | — |
| `applyGuess_swap` | 149-170 | Applying `(a, b, swap dir)` to the σ-swapped matrix equals σ-swapping after `applyGuess P a b dir` (requires `a ≠ b`); the key fact linking the two guess directions. | Key structure |
| `closeStep` | 174-187 | Single-step transitive closure: derive `P i j` from a uniform chain `i → k → j`, with `less`-chain priority over `greater`-chain at tie-breaks. | — |
| `transitiveClose` | 189-193 | Transitive closure of a `PMatrix` by iterating `closeStep` `n*n` times — enough rounds to reach fixpoint. | — |
| `conflictMatrix` | 224-237 | Concrete 4-vertex `PMatrix` witnessing a conflicted pair `(0,1)` carrying both a `less`-chain and a `greater`-chain; used to refute σ-swap commutation. | — |

| `iterate_closeStep_keeps_less` | 244-254 | Iterating `closeStep` preserves any `less` entry — once decided, frozen. | — |
| `closeStep_swap_false` | 256-265 | Refutation that `closeStep` commutes with σ-swap unconditionally — fails on `conflictMatrix` because the `less`-first tie-break is not σ-symmetric. | Machine-checked refutation |
| `transitiveClose_conflict_less` | 267-274 | Computes that `transitiveClose conflictMatrix 0 1 = .less`. | — |
| `transitiveClose_swap_conflict_less` | 276-284 | Computes that `transitiveClose (swap conflictMatrix) 0 1 = .less` — the σ-swap fails to flip the tie-break. | — |
| `transitiveClose_swap_false` | 286-300 | Refutation that `transitiveClose` commutes with σ-swap unconditionally; uses `conflictMatrix` as a 4-vertex witness. | Machine-checked refutation |

| `signature` | 307-313 | Multiset signature of vertex `v` under colouring `χ` and state `(adj, P)`: collects `(χ u, adj.adj v u, P v u)` tuples for all `u ≠ v`. | — |
| `warmRefine` | 390-399 | Warm 1-WL refinement: iterate `refineStep` `n` times starting from `initial`. `noncomputable` (downstream of `Encodable.encode`). | Definition (`noncomputable`) |
| `refineStep` / `refineStep_iff` | ~320-417 | **Concrete (2026-05-30, no longer axioms):** `refineStep adj P χ v := Encodable.encode (sigKey adj P χ v)` (own colour + sorted encoded signature = the C# `WarmPartition.RefineRound`); `refineStep_iff` (same colour ⟺ same old colour + same signature) is now a **theorem**. Removes `refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` from the axiom basis project-wide. Helpers: `POE.toNat`(_injective), `encTuple`(_injective), `sigKey`, `sigKey_eq_iff`. | Def + theorem |
| `samePartition` | 403-406 | Two colourings induce the same partition iff their equivalence classes coincide: `χ₁ i = χ₁ j ↔ χ₂ i = χ₂ j` for every `i, j`. | — |
| `refineStep_refines` | 425-430 | Refinement is split-only (one round): if two vertices end up with the same refined colour they had the same old colour. | — |
| `warmRefine_refines` | 432-458 | Warm refinement is split-only: `warmRefine adj P initial v = warmRefine adj P initial w` implies `initial v = initial w`. | — |
| `iterate_closeStep_fix` | 490-496 | Iterating `closeStep` from a fixpoint of itself stays at that fixpoint. | — |
| `cell_split_uniform_false` | 561-586 | Refutation of the original `cell_split_uniform` claim — cell-mates do not in general keep equal signatures after a guess plus TC, witnessed by `witnessP0`. | Machine-checked refutation |
| `refineStep_preserves_singleton` | 608-615 | One refinement round preserves a singleton: if no vertex shares `a`'s colour, none shares it after `refineStep` either. | — |
| `iterate_refineStep_preserves_singleton` | 617-630 | Iterating refinement preserves a singleton for any number of rounds. | — |
| `signature_applyGuess_off` | 632-646 | Off the guessed pair, the guess is invisible: for `x ∉ {a,b}` the signature under `applyGuess P₀ a b dir` equals the signature under `P₀`. | — |
| `signature_eq_of_samePartition` | 648-675 | Signature equality between two vertices is a partition invariant of the colouring: equal partitions give the same signature-equality relation. | — |
| `warm_6_2` | 677-754 | Direction invariance of warm refinement (chain-descent §6.2): with `a, b` `χι`-singletons, warm refinement after `a < b` and after `b < a` induce the same partition. | Key structure; §6.2 invariant |
| `signature_swap` | 758-768 | σ-swapping `P` relabels each signature's `POE` component by the involution `POE.swap`, leaving colour and adjacency components untouched. | — |
| `warmRefine_swap` | 770-812 | Direction-blindness (Q1): warm refinement on `P` and on its σ-swap induce the same partition. | — |
| `warmRefine_applyGuess_swap` | 814-824 | Warm refinement after `a < b` on `P₀` and after `b < a` on the σ-swapped `P₀` induce the same partition (corollary of `applyGuess_swap` and `warmRefine_swap`). | — |
| `applyGuess_comm` | 826-844 | Guesses commute (Q2): writes to disjoint matrix entries from guessing on `{a,b}` and on `{b,c}` commute when `a, b, c` are pairwise distinct. | — |
| `signature_agree_off` | 852-863 | If `P` and `Q` agree on every entry with an endpoint outside `D`, then off `D` they give the same signature. | — |
| `warmRefine_agree_off'` | 865-912 | Composable cross-branch sharing: two matrices agreeing off `D` and `samePartition`-equal starting colourings (whose `D` is all `χ`-singletons) yield the same warm-refined partition. The workhorse that chains across descent levels. | Key structure |
| `warmRefine_agree_off` | 914-948 | Cell partition depends only on the matrix off the decision set `D`: matrices agreeing off `D` (with `D` `χι`-singletoned) yield the same partition. Same-`χι` specialisation of `warmRefine_agree_off'`. | Key structure |
| `PartitionInvariant` | 965-969 | A target-cell selector is partition-invariant when it depends only on the partition the colouring induces, not on raw colour values. | — |
| `target_direction_blind` | 971-980 | For a partition-invariant selector, the target cell chosen after `a < b` equals the target after `b < a`. Base case of the descent-spine induction. | — |
| `target_agree_off` | 982-995 | Target-cell selection composes across descent levels: for a partition-invariant selector and matrices agreeing off a `D`-singletoned decision set, the target cell is the same even when start colourings only agree up to partition. | — |
| `Egnd` | 1024-1025 | The canonical ground set on `Fin n`: ordered pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j`. | — |

| `Egnd_ne` | 1030-1031 | Pairs in `Egnd n` have distinct endpoints: `p.1 ≠ p.2`. | — |
| `Pof` | 1033-1046 | Commit a set `S ⊆ Egnd n` of pair-guesses into a P-matrix: write `less` at `(u,v) ∈ S` and `greater` at `(v,u)`, leaving other entries unchanged. | Definition (`noncomputable`) |
| `cl` | 1048-1053 | Propagation closure on pair-guesses: canonical pairs whose endpoints get separated by warm refinement after committing `S`. | Definition (`noncomputable`) |

| `cl_extensive` | 1067-1082 | M1 extensiveness of `cl`: for canonical `S` whose vertices are all `χι`-singletons, every pair in `S` lies in `cl S`. | — |
| `Pof_mono_entry_of_unknown` | 1112-1136 | Entry-wise monotonicity of `Pof` from the all-unknown base: for `S ⊆ T` canonical, each entry of `Pof _ S` is either `unknown` or equal to the corresponding entry of `Pof _ T`. | — |
| `FullyDiscrete` | 1148-1150 | A colouring is fully discrete when every vertex is its own `χι`-singleton. | — |
| `cl_monotone_discrete` | 1152-1169 | M0 trivially holds under `FullyDiscrete`: every canonical pair lies in every `cl S`, so monotonicity is vacuous. | — |
| `TVerticesSingletons` | 1182-1184 | Every endpoint of every pair in `T` is a `χι`-singleton. | — |
| `warmRefine_samePartition_T_individualised` | 1186-1271 | Strong M0: warm refinement under `Pof P₀ S` and `Pof P₀ T` induce the same partition when `S ⊆ T` and every endpoint of every `T`-pair is a `χι`-singleton. | — |
| `cl_monotone_T_individualised` | 1273-1284 | M0 monotonicity of `cl` under the T-individualised hypothesis: `S ⊆ T` implies `cl S ⊆ cl T`. | — |
| `cl_idempotent` | 1310-1324 | M2 idempotence of `cl` under fresh-colour individualisation of `S ∪ cl S`: `cl (cl S) = cl S`. | — |

| `cl_prov_extensive` | 1454-1468 | CL1 for `cl_prov`: for canonical `S`, every commit's direct `less` write survives transitive closure, so `S ⊆ cl_prov S`. | — |
| `cl_prov_M3_false` | 1486-1496 | Refutation of matroid M3 exchange for `cl_prov`: concrete `n=5, S={(1,2),(3,4)}, x=(2,3), y=(1,4)` witnesses M3-premise but fails the conclusion. | Machine-checked refutation via `decide` |

| `iterate_closeStep_progress` | 1882-1909 | After `k` `closeStep` iterations either a fixpoint has been reached at some step `≤ k`, or `numUnknown` has dropped by at least `k`. | — |

| `default` | 2758-2765 | Trivial `DirAssignment`: when `P₀` is antisymmetric, `P₀` itself is a valid order assignment for any `D` (witnesses non-emptiness). | — |
| `samePartition_pair` | 2767-2779 | Any two `DirAssignment`s over the same `(P₀, D)`, refined against a `D`-singletoning colouring, induce the same partition. | — |
| `samePartition_chain` | 2781-2794 | A `DirAssignment` over a chain's `D`, refined against the chain's colouring, induces the chain's partition — the order-label residual is exactly the choice of `DirAssignment`. | — |

| `flipPair_comm` | 2879-2903 | Flips on disjoint pairs commute: when `{a,b} ∩ {c,d} = ∅`, the two `flipPair` operations commute (abelianness of the `Z₂^d` action). | — |
| `IsAut` | 2931-2934 | A `Fin n`-permutation `π` is a graph automorphism of `adj` when it preserves adjacency edge-by-edge: `adj.adj (π v) (π w) = adj.adj v w`. | — |
| `labelledAdj` | 2960-2966 | Adjacency matrix relabelled by a permutation `π`: entry `(i, j)` is the original adjacency between `π⁻¹ i` and `π⁻¹ j`. | — |
| `labelledAdj_eq_of_isAut` | 2968-2981 | Automorphisms fix the labelled adjacency: `IsAut π adj` implies `labelledAdj π adj = adj.adj`. | — |
| `isAut_of_labelledAdj_eq` | 2983-2993 | Converse: a permutation preserving the labelled adjacency is an automorphism. | — |

## ChainDescent/CascadeOracle.lean

The a-priori cascade-oracle Lean contract (plan: `docs/Archive/ChainDescent/chain-descent-cascade-oracle-lean-brief.md`). Builds axiom-clean (only `refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` + Lean foundationals), no `sorry`. Phase A = soundness/validity, Phase B = the completeness reduction (wired to the axiom-free orbit-recovery theorems), Phase C = the residual obligations: verdict iso-invariance is *discharged conditionally* (`verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete` — it reduces to localisation), and localisation is *split* into (1a) bounded-depth recoverability — **proved** on the cascade class (`RecoverableByDepth` + `recoverableByDepth_cfi`/`_scheme`, anchored by `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete`) — and (1b) intermediate-to-deep bridging, **open but not GI ∈ P** (cascade-class construction correctness). Only general-class completeness is the GI ∈ P obligation. §C.0 also proves the deferred-decisions foundation `real_stays_real`.

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `mono` | 59-68 | Orbit monotonicity in the fixed set: `S ⊆ S'` and `OrbitPartition adj P S' v w` give `OrbitPartition adj P S v w` (same witness; fixing the larger set pointwise implies fixing the smaller). | Deferred-decisions foundation; axiom-light |
| `real_stays_real` | 70-78 | Contrapositive of `mono`: a real decision (no orbit relation) at `S` stays real at every `S' ⊇ S`. Makes deferring a real decision free. | Deferred-decisions §2 |
| `orbitPartition_of_support_disjoint` | 112-126 | **Support backbone**: a `P`-preserving automorphism `π` whose `π.support` is disjoint from the individualized set `S` (= `π` fixes `S` pointwise) and sends `v→w` witnesses `OrbitPartition … S v w`. Fixing `S` collapses `π` only when `S` meets `supp(π)`. | axiom-light (no `refineStep`) |
| `exists_orbit_witness_of_aut` | 128-138 | **Availability depth**: a symmetry of support `s = |supp π|` keeps its orbit pair `(v, π v)` alive down to `S = (π.support)ᶜ` of size `n − s`. Support-graded bound: full-support (rotations) certifiable only at root, transpositions down to `n−2` (twin end). Availability, not certification (that's 1b). | axiom-light (no `refineStep`) |
| `CascadeOracleSpec` | 140-152 | A-priori cascade-oracle interface type: given a `SpineChain` (internal node, committed path `chain.D`) and reps `v w`, return `none` or a verified automorphism of `adj`. Parallel to `LinearOracleSpec` but not leaf-gated. | Definition (`Type`) |
| `some_isAut` | 3325-3337 | Soundness (subtype-level): when the oracle returns `some result`, the returned permutation is automatically an automorphism (immediate from the bundled subtype). | — |
| `OrbitMapSpec` | 169-181 | Cascade-orbit validity (the `LeafTwistSpec` analogue): a returned merge witnesses `OrbitPartition adj chain.P chain.D v w` — the soundness anchor that justifies pruning. | Definition |
| `merged_sameCell` | 183-194 | A valid (`OrbitMapSpec`) oracle never merges across 1-WL cells: a certified merge forces `v, w` into the same `warmRefine` cell. Via `OrbitPartition.subset_warmRefine`. | — |
| `OrbitRecoverableAt` | 216-225 | Oracle vocabulary for the orbit-recovery squeeze: the `Aut_S`-orbit relation equals the 1-WL cell relation at `S` — so refinement computes orbits and a complete oracle is realizable. | Definition |
| `orbitRecoverable_of_cascade` | 227-235 | General foundation: on the cascade class (`CascadesAt adj P k`), orbits are recoverable at some `S` with `S.card ≤ k`. Re-export of `theorem_1_HOR_at_depth`. | — |
| `orbitRecoverable_cfi` | 237-245 | CFI instance: OddDegree CFI graphs are orbit-recoverable at depth ≤ `cfi_depth_bound h`, via `theorem_1_HOR_cfi_oddDeg`. | axiom-free |
| `orbitRecoverable_scheme` | 247-257 | Scheme instance: rank-2, single-edge-class (`J.card = 1`) schurian scheme graphs are orbit-recoverable at depth 1, via `theorem_2_HOR_concrete_rank_two_J_singleton` (non-trivial cells). | axiom-free |
| `CellsAreOrbits` | 259-272 | The non-trivial half of `OrbitRecoverableAt`: every same-cell pair is a genuine `Aut_S` orbit pair (cells no coarser than orbits). Holds at cascade/discretizing depth, fails at generic intermediate nodes — names exactly the open content of localisation. | Definition |
| `orbitRecoverableAt_iff_cellsAreOrbits` | 274-283 | `OrbitRecoverableAt` decomposes: the orbits-refine-cells half is unconditional (`subset_warmRefine`), so recoverability **is** `CellsAreOrbits` — pinning the localisation obligation to a single implication. | — |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete` | 285-297 | **The recursion-bottom anchor**: at any discretizing depth, `CellsAreOrbits` holds for free (both cell and orbit relations collapse to equality, Fact B). Shows localisation is *not* GI-hard — the recursion deepens to discreteness where cells = orbits automatically. | axiom-free |
| `refineStep_singleton_pair_eq` | 299-324 | General-singleton round-1 match: if `s` is a `χ`-singleton and `a, b ≠ s` get the same colour after one `refineStep`, they share adjacency and `P`-relation to `s`. Arbitrary-singleton generalisation of `Scheme.refineStep_round1_pair_eq`. | axiom-light |
| `isAut_swap_of_twin` | 326-360 | **A twin pair's transposition is an automorphism**: adjacency-twins `v,w` (`adj v s = adj w s` for all other `s`) of a simple graph (`hsymm`, `hloop`) ⟹ `IsAut (Equiv.swap v w) adj`. The `adj`-only half of the twin swap witness, extracted so the linear oracle builds a `ConfigSwap` from the same twin hypothesis (`LinearOracle.configSwap_of_twin`). | axiom-light |
| `orbitPartition_swap_of_twin` | 362-427 | **Transposition orbit witness from a twin pair** (the support-grading's reconstruction core, extracted from the depth bound): an order-undecided twin pair `v,w ∉ S` (`unknown` between themselves, identical adjacency/`P` to all others) ⟹ the transposition `(v w)` witnesses `OrbitPartition adj P S v w`. Works at **any** support. Consumed by the `Sᶜ.card ≤ 2` endpoint, `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells`, and (via `isAut_swap_of_twin`) the linear oracle. | axiom-light |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_compl_card_le_two` | 429-543 | **Twin endpoint (`s = 2` end of the support-grading)**: `Sᶜ.card ≤ 2` (i.e. `|S| ≥ n−2`) ⟹ `CellsAreOrbits`. The omitted pair is a twin pair, so the transposition `(v w)` is the orbit witness (via `orbitPartition_swap_of_twin`). With `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete` pins both ends of the support spectrum. Needs `adj` symmetric+loopless, `P` antisymmetric (simple-graph/partial-order setting). | axiom-light |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells` | 545-601 | **Twin-cells: cells-are-orbits at ARBITRARY support** — the twin-reconstructible slice of localisation obligation 1b. If *every* same-cell distinct pair is an order-undecided twin pair, `CellsAreOrbits adj P S` holds for **any** `S` (no `|Sᶜ|` bound), witness = the transposition. Covers the **genuine-twin / module** abelian regime — **not** CFI, which has no twins (`CFI.cfi_triangle_no_twins`) and routes through general orbit recovery + the gadget twist. Non-twin same-cell case stays open. | axiom-light |
| `orbitRecoverableAt_of_twin_cells` | 603-622 | Oracle-vocabulary form of `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells` (via `orbitRecoverableAt_iff_cellsAreOrbits`): on the twin regime, refinement computes the `Aut_S`-orbit partition at any node with no depth bound. The within-the-wall-boundary half of localisation, discharged. | axiom-light |
| `RecoverableByDepth` | 624-633 | "There is a polynomially bounded depth where cells = orbits" — the oracle-contract cascade-class-membership predicate. The bound carries all content (unbounded form is vacuous). | Definition |
| `recoverableByDepth_of_cascade` | 635-641 | Cascade-class foundation: cascading at depth `k` ⟹ `RecoverableByDepth … k`. Re-export of `theorem_1_HOR_at_depth` via the `CellsAreOrbits` decomposition. | — |
| `recoverableByDepth_cfi` | 643-649 | **(1a) PROVED for CFI** (axiom-free, OddDegree): recoverable by depth `cfi_depth_bound h` (≤ baseSize ≤ n/6). | axiom-free |
| `recoverableByDepth_scheme` | 651-663 | **(1a) PROVED for schemes** (axiom-free, rank 2 / `|J|=1`): recoverable by depth 1 — non-trivially, at the very node the oracle acts on (cells not singletons). | axiom-free |
| `recoverableByDepth_univ` | 665-672 | The unbounded form is vacuous: every graph is recoverable by depth `n` (individualize all → discrete). So only the polynomial bound is cascade-class content. Mirror of `cascadesAt_univ`. | axiom-free |
| `CascadeComplete` | 679-686 | Completeness predicate: the oracle certifies every genuine `OrbitPartition` pair. With `OrbitMapSpec` ⟹ the oracle computes the orbit relation exactly. | Definition |
| `certifies_iff_orbit` | 688-702 | A sound (`OrbitMapSpec`) and complete (`CascadeComplete`) cascade oracle returns `some` for `v, w` iff they share an `Aut_D` orbit. | — |
| `CellComplete` | 704-711 | Cell-completeness: the oracle certifies every pair sharing a 1-WL cell — the refinement-decidable (polynomial) completeness. | Definition |
| `complete_of_cellComplete_recoverable` | 713-726 | The completeness payoff: at an orbit-recoverable node, cell-completeness suffices for orbit-completeness — the hard "certify every orbit map" reduces to the polynomial "certify every same-cell pair". | **Key theorem** |
| `VerdictIsoInvariant` | 773-786 | Verdict iso-invariance (strategy §15 gap 2): the oracle's merge decision depends only on the iso-invariant 1-WL partition (cell-equivalent pairs get the same answer). Partition-determined form. **Derivable** — see `verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete`. | Definition |
| `cascadeComplete_of_localization` | 788-799 | Capstone: cell-completeness plus all-nodes-recoverable gives `CascadeComplete`. Names the (open) localisation obligation as its two sufficient hypotheses. | — |
| `cascadeComplete_of_cellsAreOrbits` | 801-812 | Sharpened capstone: cell-completeness plus `CellsAreOrbits` at every node gives `CascadeComplete`. Same strength as `cascadeComplete_of_localization` (via the iff) but states the hypothesis as the single genuinely-open implication. | — |
| `verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete` | 814-829 | **Phase C obligation 3, discharged conditionally**: a sound + complete oracle at orbit-recoverable nodes is automatically `VerdictIsoInvariant` — its verdict equals the orbit relation (`certifies_iff_orbit`) which equals the iso-invariant cell relation. Iso-invariance ⊆ localisation, not independent. | **Key theorem** |
| `computes_orbits_of_complete` | 831-843 | Capstone: a sound + complete oracle computes the `Aut_D`-orbit relation exactly (program-level correctness, conditional on the completeness obligation). | — |

## ChainDescent/LinearOracle.lean

The linear-oracle / abelian-stripping work (tractable-buildout B2; plan + status in `docs/chain-descent-linear-oracle.md` §8.2). Built on the §15.8 scaffolding (`DirAssignment`/`flipPair`/`LinearOracleSpec`/`LeafTwistSpec`/`canonAdj`). Builds axiom-clean (`refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` + foundationals), no `sorry`. **B2 soundness core DONE 2026-05-30:** §L.1 soundness anchor, §L.2 the *forced* candidate twist (rank rebasing — the construction is determined, not searched; the `canonAdj_rebase` bridge), §L.3 abelian `Z₂^d` structure. Remaining: `canonForm` lex-min tie (needs descent-with-pruning model), completeness, lifting twists to subgroup `N` (Part A).

### §L.1 — Soundness anchor (B2.1)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `RealizesFlip` | 52-61 | The precise relation "twist `t` relabels branch `σ`'s leaf to the flipped branch `flipPair σ a b`'s leaf" (`relabelMatrix t (canonAdj σ) = canonAdj (flipPair σ a b)`). The `LeafTwistSpec` conclusion with the partner branch pinned to the flip. | Definition |
| `TwistWitness` | 63-83 | The verified data a twist discovery produces: decided pair `(a,b)`, candidate permutation `t`, its `IsAut` proof (the §4.5 edge-check — sole soundness anchor), and a `RealizesFlip` proof. | Structure |
| `twistOracle` | 85-95 | A concrete `LinearOracleSpec` instance parameterised by an abstracted `discover` function (canonical-id matching, C#-side). Returns the verified automorphism on a `TwistWitness`, `none` otherwise; verification is inside the witness so every output is a genuine automorphism. | Definition |
| `twistOracle_leafTwist` | 97-116 | **B2.1 discharge**: `twistOracle` satisfies `LeafTwistSpec`, with the flipped branch as the **explicit** witness `σ' = flipPair σ` (sharper than the bare existential). Closes the §2.3 pruning-justification contract modulo discovery. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |

### §L.2 — The forced candidate twist (B2.2 + most of B2.3)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `relabelMatrix_labelledAdj` | 141-150 | Relabelling composes: `relabelMatrix t (labelledAdj s adj) = labelledAdj (t * s) adj` — the `Equiv.Perm` group action on labelled matrices. | axiom-light |
| `canonAdj_eq_labelledAdj` | 152-157 | `canonAdj σ = labelledAdj (rankPerm π_σ) adj` for any discreteness proof (rank perm is proof-irrelevant); `rfl`. | axiom-light |
| `canonAdj_rebase` | 159-174 | **The bridge (B2.3 core)**: relabelling `σ`'s canonical leaf by the rank rebasing `rankPerm π_{σ'} * (rankPerm π_σ)⁻¹` gives `σ'`'s leaf. General over branches; the flip is the `σ' = flipPair σ` instance. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `branch_discrete` | 176-182 | A branch's warm-refined colouring is discrete at a leaf (`samePartition_chain` + `isLeaf`), derived as `canonAdj` derives it. | axiom-light |
| `candidateTwist` | 184-192 | **The forced candidate**: the rank rebasing `rankPerm π_flip * (rankPerm π_σ)⁻¹`. The twist is determined, not searched. | Definition (`noncomputable`) |
| `candidateTwist_realizesFlip` | 194-201 | The forced candidate **always** realises the flip (`canonAdj_rebase` at the flip). Construction is forced — no ambiguity. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `candidateTwist_unique` | 203-215 | Determinacy: the candidate is the unique perm rank-aligning `σ` to the flipped branch — the iso-invariance gate (§15 gap 2) at the leaf level. | axiom-light |
| `twistWitness_of_isAut` | 217-234 | The oracle reduces to verification: a verified-automorphism candidate yields a complete `TwistWitness`. Discovery = one decidable edge-check on the forced candidate. | Definition (`noncomputable`) |
| `canonicalTwistOracle` | 235-249 | A **fully concrete** `LinearOracleSpec`: for the selected pair, compute the forced candidate, return it iff `IsAut` verifies. Only abstracted piece = pair selection (which decision — soundness-irrelevant). | Definition (`noncomputable`) |
| `canonicalTwistOracle_leafTwist` | 251-259 | `canonicalTwistOracle` satisfies `LeafTwistSpec` (it is a `twistOracle`) — a concrete verified linear oracle, sound by construction. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |

### §L.3 — Abelian structure (B2.4, partial)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `candidateTwist_flip_inv` | 282-291 | The twist is a `Z₂` involution at the twist level: the forced candidate for the flip-back is the inverse of the candidate for the flip. With `DirAssignment.flipPair_comm` (commuting flips) = the elementary-abelian `Z₂^d` structure of the residual. | axiom-light |

### §L.4 — Completeness / effectiveness (when the oracle fires)

Characterizes *when* the oracle fires and proves firing is semantically justified. The
oracle is complete exactly on the **abelian regime** (forced candidate ∈ Aut) — the
calculator §6 boundary; the general converse fails (conjugation gap). The
abelian-sufficiency lemma (forced candidate IsAut for genuine abelian flips, via
`warm_6_2` rank machinery) is the open core scoped in the §L.4 doc-comment.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `candidateTwist_mul_rankPerm` | 319-327 | The forced candidate satisfies the rank-alignment equation `candidate · π_σ = π_flip`. | axiom-light |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_aligned` | 329-344 | **Firing characterisation**: `IsAut candidate ⟺ ∃ g ∈ Aut(adj)` rank-aligned (`g · π_σ = π_flip`). Forward = the candidate; backward = `candidateTwist_unique`. | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `RealizableFlip` | 346-352 | The decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry: some automorphism realises the flip (branches isomorphic). | Definition |
| `realizableFlip_of_isAut_candidateTwist` | 354-365 | **Firing is semantically justified**: when the forced candidate verifies, the branches are genuinely `Aut(adj)`-equivalent (candidate is the witness). Pruning reflects a real symmetry. | axiom-light |
| `canonicalTwistOracle_isSome_iff` | 367-383 | **The oracle fires ⟺ forced candidate is an automorphism** (given the pair selector returns `(a,b)`). The whole completeness question = one decidable edge-check. | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `candidateTwist_flipBack_isAut` | 385-396 | **`Z₂`-direction-consistency**: firing on `σ → flip` forces firing on the flip-back `flip → σ` (its inverse, via `candidateTwist_flip_inv` + `IsAut.symm`). | axiom-light |

### §L.5 — Toward abelian sufficiency (partial)

The open core of completeness — *forced candidate ∈ Aut for abelian decisions* — needs
gadget-level rank-alignment (at a leaf both branches are discrete, so `warm_6_2`'s
partition equality is vacuous; the content is in the rank order). Provable progress:

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `rankPerm_comp` | 421-441 | **Rank reindexing**: `rankPerm (χ ∘ e) = rankPerm χ · e` (relabelling conjugate-shifts the rank perm). Pure `Finset.card` reindex. The precise reason colouring-alignment gives a *conjugate* of the realizing aut, not the forced candidate — the conjugation gap. | axiom-light (`propext, Quot.sound`) |
| `candidateTwist_eq_one_of_rankPerm_eq` | 443-454 | **Absorbed decision**: equal leaf rank-perms ⟹ forced candidate `= 1`. | axiom-light |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_of_rankPerm_eq` | 456-464 | The absorbed decision fires (candidate `= 1 ∈ Aut`) — the degenerate genuine abelian instance (branches give the identical canonical leaf). | axiom-light |

### §L.7 — The CFI bridge (M1b): candidate as a conjugate of a graph automorphism

Now that `refineStep` is concrete, the cross-config transport (`§16.2b` in ChainDescent.lean)
lets us express the forced candidate via a *real* automorphism. A **config-swap** `g` carries the
σ-branch config onto the flip-branch config; it forces `π_σ = π_flip · g`, so the candidate is the
`π_σ`-conjugate of `g⁻¹`. This reduces the opaque `IsAut candidate adj` to the structural gadget
rank-alignment, isolating the genuine CFI nut (shared with Tier-3a B1 `hwit`): (1) a config-swap
exists, (2) its `π_σ`-conjugate is an automorphism.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `vertexRank_comp` | 603-621 | `vertexRank (χ ∘ g) v = vertexRank χ (g v)` — pure `Finset.card` reindex along `g`. | axiom-light |
| `ConfigSwap` | 623-635 | An automorphism carrying σ-config onto flip-config (`IsAut`, fixes `χι`, `(flipPair σ).σ (g·)(g·) = σ.σ`). For CFI: the gadget twist swapping the decided pair. | Structure |
| `configSwap_rankPerm` / `_flip` | The leaf rank perms differ by `g`: `π_σ = π_flip · g` (resp. `π_flip = π_σ · g⁻¹`), from transport + `vertexRank_comp`. | axiom-light |
| `candidateTwist_eq_conjugate` | 663-673 | **The rank-space reduction**: given a `ConfigSwap g`, `candidateTwist = π_σ · g⁻¹ · π_σ⁻¹`. The forced candidate is the `π_σ`-conjugate of a genuine graph automorphism. | axiom-light |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_conjugate` | 675-686 | `IsAut candidate adj ↔ IsAut (π_σ · g⁻¹ · π_σ⁻¹) adj` — the *rank-space* firing obligation is exactly the gadget rank-alignment. | axiom-light |

**§L.7b — vertex-model soundness (Approach C, the faithful C# model).** A config-swap is a real
graph automorphism, so both branches give the *same canonical leaf* — no rank-alignment needed. This
is the soundness the C# `TwistConstruction` actually uses (it verifies a vertex automorphism, not the
rank rebasing).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `canonAdj_eq_of_configSwap` | 697-712 | **Equal canonical leaves**: a `ConfigSwap` ⟹ `canonAdj σ = canonAdj flip` (via `π_flip = π_σ·g⁻¹` + `g⁻¹ ∈ Aut`, so relabelling by it is invisible). Pruning the flip branch loses nothing. | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `realizableFlip_of_configSwap` | 714-728 | A `ConfigSwap` ⟹ `RealizableFlip` (identity witness, since the leaves coincide) — the decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry, with no rank-alignment obligation. | axiom-light |

**§L.8 — CFI completeness: config-swap from a swapping automorphism (M1c step 3, the cascade-1b bridge).**
*Where a config-swap comes from.* A swapping automorphism `g` (`g a = b`, `g b = a`) is exactly an
`OrbitPartition adj P S a b` witness specialised to the size-2 decision cell — the cascade oracle's
currency. So linear-oracle CFI completeness reduces to the **shared cascade-1b** obligation
(bounded-depth half `recoverableByDepth_cfi` proved; decision-node-depth bridge open, *not* `GI∈P`).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `configSwap_of_swap` | 760-827 | **Closed instance**: a σ-cell-coherent *transposition* automorphism (`g` swaps `a,b`, fixes the rest + `χι`; `σ.σ a w = σ.σ b w` off the pair) *is* a `ConfigSwap`. The `Z₂` twin-swap — the simplest genuine abelian decision. Real proof content (swap case-analysis + antisymmetry). | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `configSwap_of_twin` | 829-857 | **The twin → config-swap bridge** (linear-oracle analog of `CascadeOracle.cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells`, sharing the twin hypothesis + the `isAut_swap_of_twin` witness): an **(adj, σ)-twin** decision pair (adjacency-twin on a simple graph + σ-cell-coherent, `χι a = χι b`) ⟹ `ConfigSwap`, via `configSwap_of_swap` fed by `isAut_swap_of_twin`. Closes the **genuine-twin / module** abelian decision class — both oracles fire on the same twin class through one shared lemma. **Not** CFI (no twins; CFI uses the general non-transposition gadget twist). | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `ConfigSwapRecoverable` | 859-869 | Graph-level predicate: every leaf decision admits a config-swap = the linear oracle's **decision-node recoverability** = the named cascade-1b obligation (analog of `AbelianSufficiencyHolds`). | def |
| `canonAdj_eq_of_configSwapRecoverable` | 871-882 | Capstone (pruning soundness): `ConfigSwapRecoverable` ⟹ both branches give the identical canonical leaf at every decision. | axiom-light |
| `realizableFlip_of_configSwapRecoverable` | 884-895 | Capstone (real symmetry): `ConfigSwapRecoverable` ⟹ every decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry — vertex-model completeness, no rank-alignment. | axiom-light |

Open (not a `sorry`): `configSwapRecoverable_of_cfi : IsCFI adj → ConfigSwapRecoverable` — the general
gadget twist (non-transposition `g`, moves the whole coupled component) needs the deferred Stage-3
`Aut(CFI) ≅ Z₂^β ⋊ Aut(H)` machinery = the same `hwit` as Tier-3a B1; plus the decision-node-depth half
of cascade-1b.

Transport chain it builds on (ChainDescent.lean `§16.2b`): `signature_transport`, `sigKey_transport`,
`refineStep_transport`, `iterate_refineStep_transport`, `warmRefine_transport` — cross-config (two
`(P,χ)` related by an automorphism), the value-level generalisation of the `*_invariant_of_isAut`
chain, newly provable because `refineStep` is concrete. All axiom-light.

### §L.6 — Relativized completeness (the retargeting)

The general completeness statement ("forced candidate fires whenever the branches are
isomorphic") *provably* cannot close — a realizing aut agrees with the forced candidate only
up to a conjugate of `Aut(adj)` (`rankPerm_comp`), the split-or-Johnson wall *by design*, and
the **same gap the a-priori cascade oracle carries** (`CascadeOracle.lean` §4.3). The fix is
the cascade oracle's **Phase-B move**: relativize completeness to the recoverable/abelian
class and reduce it to orbit recovery. This scaffold names the relativized target and isolates
the one open obligation (`AbelianSufficiencyHolds` on the CFI class — the leaf-level instance
of orbit recovery, the same nut as Tier-3a B1's `hwit`).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `RankAligned` | 501-509 | The algebraic firing condition: a rank-aligned automorphism exists (`∃ g ∈ Aut, g · π_σ = π_flip`). | Definition |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_rankAligned` | 511-519 | **Interface**: forced candidate `∈ Aut ⟺ RankAligned`. The whole completeness question is "does a rank-aligned aut exist?" (= `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_aligned`). | axiom-light |
| `AbelianSufficiency` | 521-531 | **Per-decision relativized target**: `RealizableFlip → IsAut candidate`. FALSE in the non-abelian regime (the wall); the claim to discharge on the abelian/cascade class. | Definition |
| `oracleFires_of_abelianSufficiency` | 533-548 | **Capstone (what suffices)**: `AbelianSufficiency` + a real symmetry ⟹ the oracle fires. Linear-oracle analog of cascade's `cascadeComplete_of_localization`. | axiom-light |
| `abelianSufficiency_of_rankPerm_eq` | 550-561 | **Non-vacuous closed instance**: the absorbed decision is abelian-sufficient (candidate `= 1 ∈ Aut` outright). Validates the scaffold. | axiom-light |
| `AbelianSufficiencyHolds` | 563-571 | Graph-level discharge target (every leaf decision abelian-sufficient). Open obligation `abelianSufficiencyHolds_of_cfi : IsCFI adj → AbelianSufficiencyHolds adj` (downstream, via `theorem_1_HOR_cfi_oddDeg` — the gadget rank-alignment = B1 `hwit`). | Definition |
| `oracleFires_of_abelianSufficiencyHolds` | 573-587 | **Graph-level capstone**: `AbelianSufficiencyHolds` ⟹ the oracle fires at every leaf decision that is a real symmetry (relativized completeness on the abelian class). | axiom-light |

## ChainDescent/Group.lean

Part A (A1–A3) of `docs/chain-descent-tier3-tractable-buildout.md` — the group object
the orbit-recovery program deliberately avoided, now needed for Tier-3 vocabulary
(`H₀ ⊵ … ⊵ H_k`, quotient graphs). Pure glue over Mathlib group theory + the existing
`IsAut` lemmas; **no `refineStep`** dependency (axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
A4 (the quotient *graph* `G/H` + cell = quotient-vertex lemma) is **not** here — it is the
medium-risk Mathlib gap gating B1.

### A1 — `Aut(G)` as a group

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `AutGroup adj` | The subgroup `{π | IsAut π adj}` of `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`. `Subgroup` axioms discharged from `IsAut.refl/.trans/.symm` (`mul_mem'` uses `a * b = b.trans a`). | Definition |
| `mem_autGroup` | 69-70 | `π ∈ AutGroup adj ↔ IsAut π adj`. | `@[simp]` |
| `orbitPartition_iff_autGroup` | 72-87 | **The bridge**: `OrbitPartition adj P S v w ↔ ∃ g : AutGroup adj, (g preserves P) ∧ FixesPointwise ↑g S ∧ ↑g v = w` — repackages `OrbitPartition`'s bare `π` as a group element (in the pointwise-`S`-stabilizer), keeping `OrbitPartition` the working object. | axiom-light |

### A2 — Action on vertices + orbit bridge

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `autGroup_smul` | 96-98 | The subgroup action's smul is permutation application: `g • v = (↑g) v`. | `@[simp]`, `rfl` |
| `mem_orbit_autGroup_iff` | 100-109 | `w ∈ MulAction.orbit (AutGroup adj) v ↔ ∃ π, IsAut π adj ∧ π v = w` — orbit membership unfolded (pure, pre-`P`). | axiom-light |
| `mem_orbit_autGroup_iff_orbitPartition` | 111-125 | **Orbit bridge**: under `P`-invariance (`∀ π, IsAut π adj → π preserves P`; the Tier-2 `hP_invariant` pattern), `v`'s `AutGroup`-orbit = the root relation `OrbitPartition adj P ∅` (no individualization). | axiom-light |

### A3 — Normal subgroup chains

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `LayerChain adj` | A finite descending chain `AutGroup adj = layer 0 ⊵ … ⊵ layer len = ⊥` with each layer relatively normal in its predecessor (`(layer (i+1)).subgroupOf (layer i)` is `Normal`). The `H₀ ⊵ … ⊵ H_k` substrate B1 (Tier 3a) is stated over. | Structure |
| `LayerChain.trivial` | The one-step chain `AutGroup adj ⊵ ⊥` (`⊥` normal in anything) — witnesses `LayerChain` is inhabited (`Inhabited` instance). | Definition |

### A4 — quotient graph + cell = quotient-vertex

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `orbitSetoid adj P S` | The `Aut_S`-orbit relation `OrbitPartition adj P S` packaged as a `Setoid` (from its proved `refl/symm/trans`). | Definition |
| `OrbitQuotient adj P S` | **The quotient vertex set** `V(G)/Aut_S` = `Quotient (orbitSetoid …)`. `Fintype` + `DecidableEq` instances (noncomputable, classical). | `abbrev` |
| `orbitMk` / `orbitMk_eq_iff` | The quotient map `v ↦ ⟦v⟧`; `orbitMk v = orbitMk w ↔ OrbitPartition adj P S v w`. | Definition / `Quotient.eq` |
| `cell_iff_orbitMk_eq` | 226-242 | **The cell = quotient-vertex lemma** (B1's induction step): under `CellsAreOrbits`, `v,w` share a 1-WL cell of `(G,S)` **iff** `orbitMk v = orbitMk w`. Forward = `CellsAreOrbits`+`Quotient.sound`; backward = unconditional `subset_warmRefine`+`Quotient.exact`. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `QuotientAdjCompatible` | 246-254 | The well-definedness condition for a simple induced quotient adjacency: `adj v w` constant on `Aut_S`-orbit pairs. (Genuinely conditional — fails for coarse `S`; the multigraph subtlety the doc flags.) | Definition |
| `quotientAdj` / `quotientAdj_mk` | The induced adjacency on `OrbitQuotient`, well-defined under `QuotientAdjCompatible` (via `Quotient.lift₂`); `quotientAdj h ⟦v⟧ ⟦w⟧ = adj.adj v w` (`rfl`). | Definition / `@[simp]` |
| `quotientAdjCompatible_of_discrete` | 269-280 | At discreteness the quotient graph is always well-defined (orbits singletons) — the recursion-bottom anchor, paralleling `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete`. | axiom-light |
| `orbitPartition_empty_iff_orbitRel` | 290-302 | The root orbit relation `OrbitPartition adj P ∅` = the `AutGroup` `MulAction` orbit relation (under `P`-invariance) — relational form, symmetrised for `orbitRel`. | axiom-light |
| `orbitQuotientEquivAutGroup` | 304-312 | **The root quotient is `V(G)/Aut(G)`**: `OrbitQuotient adj P ∅ ≃ MulAction.orbitRel.Quotient (AutGroup adj) (Fin n)` (under `P`-invariance), tying A4's relational quotient back to A1/A2's group object. | Definition (`noncomputable`) |

## ChainDescent/Cascade.lean

B1 (Tier 3a cascade composition) of `docs/chain-descent-tier3-tractable-buildout.md`,
Phases A + C. Build plan: `docs/chain-descent-tier3a-b1-build-plan.md`. The headline
"depths add" theorem, **conditional on the per-layer transfer** (`LayerStep`, = paper
§4.2.5, discharged in the not-yet-built Phase D). Stays on `Fin n` (no quotient
re-typing) by telescoping cumulative individualization sets. Axiom-clean (standard
basis; `refineStep` via `warmRefine`).

### Phase A — interface

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `IsBase adj P T` | `T` is a base of the `P`-preserving automorphism group: `Aut_T`-orbits are trivial (`OrbitPartition adj P T v w → v = w`). The chain's bottom `H_k = {1}`. | Definition |
| `LayerStep adj P T S` | The per-layer transfer obligation: `CellsAreOrbits adj P T → CellsAreOrbits adj P (T ∪ S)` (paper §4.2.5 transferred to `G`). Consumed by the composition induction; discharged from Tier-1/2 in Phase D. | Definition |
| (cascade-class predicate) | `RecoverableByDepth adj P bound` (in `CascadeOracle.lean`) — Tier-1 (`recoverableByDepth_cfi`) / Tier-2 (`recoverableByDepth_scheme`) instances already proved. | (existing) |

### Phase C — composition theorem

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `discrete_of_cellsAreOrbits_base` | 69-76 | **(C1) Finish**: `CellsAreOrbits adj P T` + `IsBase adj P T` ⟹ `Discrete (warmRefine … T)`. Same-cell → same-orbit → equality. | axiom-light |
| `cellsAreOrbits_compose` | 78-91 | **(C2) The induction**: from layer-1 recoverability (`CellsAreOrbits` at `T 0`) + per-layer steps (`hstep i : CellsAreOrbits (T i) → CellsAreOrbits (T (i+1))`), conclude `CellsAreOrbits` at the final cumulative `T k`. Telescopes the layers. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `cumulative_card_le` | 93-99 | **Depths add (cardinality)**: `|⋃_{i≤k} S i| ≤ Σ_{i≤k} f i` when `|S i| ≤ f i` (`card_biUnion_le` + `sum_le_sum`). | axiom-light |
| `cascadeComposition` | 101-113 | **Theorem 3a headline (conditional)**: cumulative sets + layer-1 base + per-layer transfer steps + final set a base ⟹ warm refinement at `T k` is `Discrete`. With `cumulative_card_le`, depth `≤ Σ fᵢ`. Conditional on `hstep` (= §4.2.5, Phase D). | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `cascadeComposition_single` | 121-124 | The `k = 0` case: a single cascade-class layer (Tier-1/2) that is a base reaches discreteness — recovers the orbit-recovery theorems as the composition's base case. | axiom-light |

### Phase D — discharging `LayerStep` (the §4.2.5 transfer), intrinsic route

Approach B (build-plan §3): stay on `Fin n`, reduce `LayerStep` to a witness-upgrade via
**set-monotonicity** of warm refinement (reusing `refineStep_iff`); the materialized-quotient
route was rejected (`refineStep` axiomatic, no cross-size API).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `Refines χ₁ χ₂` | `χ₁` refines `χ₂` (finer partition): `∀ a b, χ₁ a = χ₁ b → χ₂ a = χ₂ b`. | Definition |
| `signature_refines` | 142-163 | **The crux**: `Refines χ₁ χ₂` ⟹ equal `χ₁`-signatures give equal `χ₂`-signatures (`signature χ₂ = (signature χ₁).map G` for a coarsening map `G` built from `Refines`). | axiom-light |
| `refineStep_mono` | 165-171 | `Refines χ₁ χ₂ → Refines (refineStep χ₁) (refineStep χ₂)` (via `refineStep_iff` + `signature_refines`). | axiom-light |
| `iterate_refineStep_refines` / `warmRefine_refines_initial` | warm refinement monotone in the initial colouring's partition order. | axiom-light |
| `individualizedColouring_refines` | 189-201 | `T ⊆ T'` ⟹ `Refines (individualizedColouring n T') (individualizedColouring n T)`. | axiom-light |
| `warmRefine_indiv_mono` | 203-211 | **Set-monotonicity (the payoff)**: same `(T ∪ S)`-cell ⟹ same `T`-cell. "1-WL monotone in the individualization set" — the lemma the docs had mis-cited as `warmRefine_refines`. | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `WitnessUpgrade adj P T S` | The genuine §4.2.5 content: same-`Aut_T`-orbit + same-`(T∪S)`-cell `v,w` ⟹ `OrbitPartition (T∪S) v w` (the orbit relation upgrades to the finer stabilizer). | Definition |
| `layerStep_of_witnessUpgrade` | 225-232 | **The reduction**: a witness-upgrade discharges a `LayerStep` (via `warmRefine_indiv_mono` + `CellsAreOrbits T`). Where Phase C meets the per-layer content. | **Key**; axiom-light |
| `layerStep_empty` / `layerStep_subset` / `layerStep_of_cellsAreOrbits` / `layerStep_of_discrete` | Trivial real instances: no-op layer (`S = ∅`), `S ⊆ T`, independently-recoverable target, and the discretizing recursion-bottom. | axiom-light |
| `witnessUpgrade_of_pathFixing` | 257-272 | **Bridge to harvested generators**: if every same-orbit, same-cell pair has a `P`-preserving automorphism with support disjoint from `T ∪ S` (fixing the committed path) sending `v ↦ w`, the upgrade holds (`orbitPartition_of_support_disjoint`). Exactly what the cascade/linear oracles produce. | axiom-light |

### Step 5 — the synthesis (Theorem 3a reduced to harvested generators)

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `cascadeComposition_pathFixing` | 291-312 | **Theorem 3a, reduced to harvested path-fixing generators**: cumulative sets by increments + layer-1 recoverable + *every layer's residual symmetry realized by path-fixing automorphisms* (`hwit`, = harvested generators) + final set a base ⟹ warm refinement at `T k` is `Discrete`. Reduces the whole of Theorem 3a to one hypothesis (per-layer path-fixing witness existence). The bridge to calculator §2's harvested-chain picture. | **Key theorem**; axiom-light |
| `cascadeComposition_twoLayer` | 314-329 | The smallest genuine composition: outer cascade-class layer at `T₀` + inner path-fixing layer (increment `S`) + union a base ⟹ `Discrete`. The `CFI(scheme)` / `Scheme(CFI)` shape once the inner witnesses are constructed. | axiom-light |
