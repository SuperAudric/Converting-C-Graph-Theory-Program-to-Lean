# Public Theorem Index — GraphCanonizationProofs

Index of public Lean theorems, lemmas, and definitions in the GraphCanonizationProofs project (active source), grouped by source file path. Archived counterparts live in `Archive/PublicTheoremIndex.md`. Private declarations live in `PrivateTheoremIndex.md`.

Maintained by `scripts/GenerateTheoremIndexes.py rewrite --with-line-numbers`: the **Name**, **Line**, and **Notes** columns are computed from source; **Description** is hand-written and preserved. Prose between tables (this note, the Legend, `### …` sub-headers, per-file descriptions) is passed through untouched.
## Legend

- **Line**: Source-line range `start-end` covering the declaration's header (attached doc comment / attributes) and its full body. Collapses to a single number when the declaration occupies one line. Gaps between theorems represent whitespace or comments.
- **Description**: What the declaration achieves / why a consumer would use it (not how it is proved), in ≤ 2 sentences. A leading `§…` section marker or **bold anchor** links it to the documentation.
- **Notes**: Computed from source — the infrastructure kind (`Definition`/`Structure`/`Inductive`/`Class`/`abbrev`/`axiom`/`Instance`), `noncomputable`, and `@[…]` attributes. `private` is omitted (it is encoded by the public/private index split).

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `POE` | 70-74 | Partial-order entries: the three values `less`, `unknown`, `greater` that populate a `PMatrix`. | Inductive |
| `neg` | 87-91 | Antisymmetric reverse on one entry: swaps `less`/`greater`, fixes `unknown`. | Definition |
| `neg_neg` | 93-94 | `neg` is an involution: `neg (neg e) = e`. | `@[simp]` |
| `POE.swap` | 96-99 | σ-swap on one entry (the matrix-wide relabelling of the direction-symmetry argument); coincides with `neg`. | Definition |
| `POE.swap_swap` | 101 | σ-swap is an involution: `swap (swap e) = e`. | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_less` | 103 | `swap .less = .greater`. | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_greater` | 104 | `swap .greater = .less`. | `@[simp]` |
| `swap_unknown` | 105 | `swap .unknown = .unknown`. | `@[simp]` |
| `PMatrix` | 111-112 | The partial-order matrix type `Fin n → Fin n → POE`. | Definition |
| `swap` | 118-119 | Pointwise σ-swap of a `PMatrix`: swap `less` with `greater` at every entry. | Definition |
| `swap_swap` | 121-122 | σ-swap is an involution on `PMatrix`: `swap (swap P) = P`. | `@[simp]` |
| `Antisymmetric` | 124-126 | A `PMatrix` is antisymmetric when `P i j = POE.neg (P j i)` for all `i, j`. | Definition |
| `AdjMatrix` | 135-136 | Self-contained adjacency matrix on `Fin n`, wrapping a `Fin n → Fin n → Nat` field. | Structure |
| `applyGuess` | 140-147 | Apply a single guess `(a, b, dir)` to `P`: set `P a b := dir`, `P b a := neg dir`, leaving every other entry unchanged. Does not transitively close. | Definition |
| `applyGuess_swap` | 149-170 | Applying `(a, b, swap dir)` to the σ-swapped matrix equals σ-swapping after `applyGuess P a b dir` (needs `a ≠ b`); links the two guess directions through σ. | — |
| `closeStep` | 174-187 | Single-step transitive closure: derive `P i j` from a uniform chain `i → k → j`, with `less`-chains taking priority over `greater`-chains at ties. | Definition |
| `transitiveClose` | 189-193 | Transitive closure of a `PMatrix` by iterating `closeStep` `n*n` times — enough rounds to reach fixpoint. | Definition |
| `conflictMatrix` | 224-237 | Concrete 4-vertex witness with a conflicted pair `(0,1)` carrying both a `less`-chain and a `greater`-chain; refutes σ-swap commutation. | Definition |
| `closeStep_swap_false` | 256-265 | **Refutation:** `closeStep` does not commute with σ-swap unconditionally — the `less`-first tie-break is not σ-symmetric (fails on `conflictMatrix`). | — |
| `transitiveClose_swap_false` | 286-300 | **Refutation:** `transitiveClose` does not commute with σ-swap unconditionally (witnessed by `conflictMatrix`). | — |
| `Colouring` | 304-305 | A vertex colouring `Fin n → Nat`. | Definition |
| `signature` | 307-313 | Multiset signature of vertex `v` under colouring `χ` and state `(adj, P)`: the `(χ u, adj.adj v u, P v u)` tuples over all `u ≠ v`. | Definition |
| `POE.toNat` | 315-320 | Numeric code for a `POE` entry matching the C# packing: `less ↦ 0`, `unknown ↦ 1`, `greater ↦ 2`. | Definition |
| `encTuple` | 326-332 | Canonical injection of a signature tuple `(colour, edge-label, POE)` into `Nat` (Cantor pairing); mirrors the C# neighbour-tuple packing. | Definition |
| `sigKey` | 341-348 | Canonical refinement key of a vertex: its old colour followed by the sorted encoded signature multiset (the C# `[own-colour, sorted neighbour-tuples]`). | Definition |
| `sigKey_eq_iff` | 350-364 | Two vertices share a `sigKey` iff they have the same old colour and the same signature. | — |
| `warmRefine` | 393-403 | Warm 1-WL refinement: iterate `refineStep` `n` times from `initial`; concrete and computable. | Definition |
| `refineStep` / `refineStep_iff` | ~320-417 | **Concrete (2026-05-30, no longer axioms):** `refineStep adj P χ v := Encodable.encode (sigKey adj P χ v)` (own colour + sorted encoded signature = the C# `WarmPartition.RefineRound`); `refineStep_iff` (same colour ⟺ same old colour + same signature) is now a **theorem**. Removes `refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` from the axiom basis project-wide. Helpers: `POE.toNat`(_injective), `encTuple`(_injective), `sigKey`, `sigKey_eq_iff`. | Def + theorem |
| `samePartition` | 407-410 | Two colourings induce the same partition: `χ₁ i = χ₁ j ↔ χ₂ i = χ₂ j` for every `i, j`. | Definition |
| `samePartition.refl` | 416 | `samePartition` is reflexive. | — |
| `samePartition.symm` | 418-419 | `samePartition` is symmetric. | — |
| `samePartition.trans` | 421-423 | `samePartition` is transitive. | — |
| `refineStep_refines` | 429-434 | **Refinement is split-only (one round).** Equal refined colour implies equal old colour. | — |
| `warmRefine_refines` | 436-462 | Warm refinement is split-only: equal warm-refined colour implies equal starting colour. | — |
| `iterate_closeStep_fix` | 494-500 | Iterating `closeStep` from a fixpoint of itself stays at that fixpoint. | — |
| `cell_split_uniform_false` | 565-590 | **Refutation:** cell-mates do not in general keep equal signatures after a guess plus TC (witnessed by `witnessP0`, the gap fixed only by singleton-cell `a`, `b`). | — |
| `refineStep_preserves_singleton` | 612-619 | One refinement round preserves a singleton: if no vertex shares `a`'s colour, none does after `refineStep`. | — |
| `iterate_refineStep_preserves_singleton` | 621-634 | Iterating refinement preserves a singleton for any number of rounds. | — |
| `signature_applyGuess_off` | 636-650 | Off the guessed pair, the guess is invisible: for `x ∉ {a,b}` the signature under `applyGuess P₀ a b dir` equals the signature under `P₀`. | — |
| `signature_eq_of_samePartition` | 652-679 | **Signature equality is a partition invariant of the colouring:** partition-equal colourings induce the same signature-equality relation between vertices. | — |
| `warm_6_2` | 681-758 | **§6.2 direction invariance.** With `a, b` `χι`-singletons, warm refinement after `a < b` and after `b < a` induce the same partition. | — |
| `signature_swap` | 762-772 | σ-swapping `P` relabels each signature's `POE` component by `POE.swap`, leaving colour and adjacency components untouched. | — |
| `warmRefine_swap` | 774-816 | **Direction-blindness (Q1).** Warm refinement on `P` and on its σ-swap induce the same partition. | — |
| `warmRefine_applyGuess_swap` | 818-828 | Warm refinement after `a < b` on `P₀` and after `b < a` on the σ-swapped `P₀` induce the same partition. | — |
| `applyGuess_comm` | 830-848 | **Q2 — guesses commute.** Guessing on `{a,b}` then `{b,c}` (pairwise-distinct vertices) gives the same `(adj, P)` as the reverse order, since the writes touch disjoint matrix entries. | — |
| `signature_agree_off` | 856-867 | If `P` and `Q` agree on every entry with an endpoint outside `D`, then off `D` they yield the same signature. | — |
| `warmRefine_agree_off'` | 869-916 | **§6.2 — composable cross-branch sharing.** Matrices agreeing off `D` and `samePartition`-equal starting colourings (with `D` all `χ`-singletons) yield the same warm-refined partition; the cross-level form that chains across descent levels. | — |
| `warmRefine_agree_off` | 918-952 | **§6.2 — the cell partition depends only on the matrix off the decision set `D`.** Matrices agreeing off `D` (its vertices `χι`-singletoned) yield the same partition; the same-`χι` specialisation of `warmRefine_agree_off'`. | — |
| `PartitionInvariant` | 969-973 | A target-cell selector is partition-invariant when it depends only on the partition a colouring induces, not on raw colour values. | Definition |
| `target_direction_blind` | 975-984 | **§6.2 spine — base case.** For a partition-invariant selector, the target cell chosen after `a < b` equals the one after `b < a`. | — |
| `target_agree_off` | 986-999 | **§6.2 spine — inductive step.** For a partition-invariant selector and matrices agreeing off a singletoned decision set `D`, the target cell is the same even when the start colourings only agree up to partition. | — |
| `Egnd` | 1028-1029 | **§13.** The canonical ground set on `Fin n`: ordered pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j`. | Definition |

| `Egnd_ne` | 1034-1035 | Pairs in `Egnd n` have distinct endpoints: `p.1 ≠ p.2`. | — |
| `Pof` | 1037-1050 | **§13.** Commit a set `S ⊆ Egnd n` of pair-guesses into a P-matrix: write `less` at `(u,v) ∈ S`, `greater` at `(v,u)`, leaving other entries unchanged. | Definition, `noncomputable` |
| `cl` | 1052-1057 | **§13.** Propagation closure on pair-guesses: the canonical pairs whose endpoints get separated by warm refinement after committing `S`. | Definition |

| `cl_extensive` | 1071-1086 | **§13 M1 — extensiveness of `cl`.** For canonical `S` whose vertices are all `χι`-singletons, every pair in `S` lies in `cl S`. | — |
| `Pof_mono_entry_of_unknown` | 1116-1140 | Entry-wise monotonicity of `Pof` from the all-unknown base: for canonical `S ⊆ T`, each entry of `Pof _ S` is either `unknown` or equal to the corresponding `Pof _ T` entry (does not lift to a `cl` monotonicity result). | — |
| `FullyDiscrete` | 1152-1154 | A colouring is fully discrete when every vertex is its own `χι`-singleton. | Definition |
| `cl_monotone_discrete` | 1156-1173 | **§13 M0, vacuous case.** Under `FullyDiscrete`, every canonical pair lies in every `cl S`, so `cl S = Egnd n` and monotonicity carries no structural information. | — |
| `TVerticesSingletons` | 1186-1188 | Every endpoint of every pair in `T` is a `χι`-singleton. | Definition |
| `warmRefine_samePartition_T_individualised` | 1190-1275 | **§13 M0, strong form.** Warm refinement under `Pof P₀ S` and `Pof P₀ T` induces the *same* partition when `S ⊆ T` and every endpoint of every `T`-pair is a `χι`-singleton. | — |

| `cl_idempotent` | 1314-1328 | **§13 M2 — idempotence of `cl`** under fresh-colour individualisation of `S ∪ cl S`: `cl (cl S) = cl S`. | — |
| `Pof_fs` | 1400-1406 | **§14.** Finset-based computable analogue of `Pof`, enabling `decide`-checkable refutations. | Definition |

| `cl_prov_empty` | 1448-1457 | **§14 CL0 for `cl_prov`:** `cl_prov ∅ = ∅`. | — |
| `cl_prov_extensive` | 1459-1473 | **§14 CL1 for `cl_prov`:** for canonical `S`, every commit's direct `less` write survives transitive closure, so `S ⊆ cl_prov S`. | — |
| `cl_prov_M3_false` | 1491-1501 | **§14 — refutes matroid M3 exchange for `cl_prov`.** A concrete `n=5, S={(1,2),(3,4)}, x=(2,3), y=(1,4)` counterexample where the M3 premise holds but the conclusion fails; machine-checked by `decide`. | — |

| `LessMono` | 1530-1533 | One-sided `.less`-direction entry-wise monotonicity between two matrices: `P i j = .less → Q i j = .less`. | Definition |

| `closeStep_eq_greater_iff` | 1659-1711 | `closeStep P i j = .greater` iff `P i j` was already `.greater`, or it was `.unknown` with no `.less`-chain but a `.greater`-chain. | — |

| `numUnknown_le` | 1842-1847 | `numUnknown P ≤ n * n`. | — |
| `closeStep_numUnknown_lt` | 1860-1885 | If `closeStep P ≠ P`, then `numUnknown` strictly drops under one closure round. | — |
| `iterate_closeStep_progress` | 1887-1914 | After `k` `closeStep` iterations, either a fixpoint has been reached at some step `≤ k`, or `numUnknown` has dropped by at least `k`. | — |
| `transitiveClose_is_fixpoint` | 1916-1966 | After `n*n` iterations of `closeStep`, the result is a fixpoint: `closeStep (transitiveClose P) = transitiveClose P`. | — |

| `IndivStep` | 2122-2146 | Existential witness of one descent-step individualisation: a colouring `χ'` that singletons every vertex in target `T` and refines `χ` outside `T`. Data, not a function — the trace carries one per step. | Structure |
| `singletons_union` | 2150-2171 | **D-singletons preserved.** If `χ` singletons every `v ∈ D`, an `IndivStep` with target `T` singletons every `v ∈ D ∪ T`. | — |
| `samePartition_of_samePartition` | 2173-2203 | Two `IndivStep`s applied to `samePartition`-equal colourings with the same target `T` produce `samePartition`-equal results — the inductive engine of the spine theorem. | — |
| `IndivStep.default` | 2205-2256 | **Concrete `IndivStep` witness.** A constructive individualisation step (parity-tagged base-`n` encoding), proving traces exist at every level so the spine theorem is non-vacuous. | Definition |
| `DescentTrace` | 2265-2303 | Inductive predicate: `(D, P, χι)` is reachable by `k` descent steps from `(P₀, χι₀)` under selector `sel`, each step carrying an `IndivStep` witness and a matrix agreeing with `P₀` off the enlarged decision set. | Inductive |

| `spine_branch_independent` | 2380-2454 | **The spine theorem (branch independence).** Any two `DescentTrace`s through `k` levels agree on the accumulated `D` (literal) and the level-`k` partition (`samePartition`) — handing the oracle one fixed partition instead of `2^d` refinement worlds. | — |
| `SpineChain.branch_independent` | 2456-2465 | **The spine theorem, `SpineChain` wrapper.** Two chains at level `k` share `D` and level-`k` partition. | — |
| `defaultColouring` | 2486-2496 | The level-`k` colouring of the default reference chain: iterate refine-then-individualise (via `IndivStep.default`) from `χι₀`, with the matrix held fixed at `P₀`. | Definition |

| `SpineChain.eq_default` | 2534-2545 | **Reference corollary.** Every `SpineChain` at level `k` shares `D` and level-`k` partition with `defaultSpineChain` — there is a canonical level-`k` partition, computable by one deterministic descent. | — |
| `Discrete` | 2569-2572 | A colouring is discrete when every cell is a singleton — equivalently, `χ : Fin n → Nat` is injective. | Definition |

| `warmRefine_preserves` | 2582-2591 | Warm refinement preserves discreteness: if `χ` is injective, so is `warmRefine adj P χ`. | — |
| `SpineChain.IsLeaf` | 2595-2601 | A `SpineChain` reaches a leaf when its level-`k` partition is discrete (every vertex a singleton). | Definition |

| `DirAssignment` | 2751-2757 | Order assignment relative to `(P₀, D)`: an antisymmetric matrix agreeing with `P₀` on every entry with an endpoint outside `D`. The linear oracle's input shape — a point in the order-label residual. | Structure |
| `default` | 2763-2770 | **Trivial `DirAssignment`.** When `P₀` is antisymmetric, `P₀` itself is a valid order assignment for any `D` (witnesses non-emptiness). | Definition |
| `samePartition_pair` | 2772-2784 | Any two `DirAssignment`s over the same `(P₀, D)`, refined against a `D`-singletoning colouring, induce the same partition. | — |
| `samePartition_chain` | 2786-2799 | **Spine equivalence.** A `DirAssignment` over a chain's `D`, refined against the chain's colouring, induces the chain's partition — the residual is exactly the choice of `DirAssignment`, partition fixed. | — |
| `flipPair` | 2803-2847 | **Single-pair direction flip.** Negate the `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` entries of a `DirAssignment` via `POE.neg`. The generator of the `Z₂` group action on direction choices. | Definition |
| `eq_of_σ_eq` | 2849-2859 | `DirAssignment` equality is determined by the matrix field — propositional fields subsumed by proof irrelevance. | — |
| `flipPair_idempotent` | 2861-2870 | **Flip is an involution.** Two applications of `flipPair` to the same pair return the original `DirAssignment` — the `Z₂` generator squares to identity. | — |
| `flipPair_partition_invariant` | 2872-2882 | **Flipping preserves the partition.** `σ` and `σ.flipPair a b` share the spine partition — the order labels move, the partition doesn't. | — |
| `flipPair_comm` | 2884-2908 | **Flips on disjoint pairs commute** — the abelian-ness of the `Z₂^d` action: distinct decisions don't interfere. | — |
| `IsAut` | 2936-2939 | A `Fin n`-permutation `π` is a graph automorphism of `adj` when it preserves adjacency edge-by-edge: `adj.adj (π v) (π w) = adj.adj v w`. | Definition |

surjectivity half is needed by no consumer. Both consumers (`LinearOracle.configSwap_of_aut`
and Tier-3a B1's `hwit`) want the same object: a CFI automorphism with controlled support,
realised by the even-subgraph (cycle-space) flip. Phases 0–1 below; Phases 2–6 (adjacency
preservation, `Fin n` lift, support/locality, `P`-preservation, consumer wiring) follow.*

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `card_symmDiff_mod_two` | **Parity helper.** `|S ∆ T| ≡ |S| + |T| (mod 2)` — the fact behind "an even subgraph preserves the even-subset invariant." | private |
| `CFIBase.flipSet` | The `F`-incident neighbours of `v` (`F : Fin m → Fin m → Bool` an even subgraph), as a subset of `N(v)`. | Definition |
| `CFIBase.symmDiff_flipSet_mem_even` | **Even-subset invariant preserved.** If every `flipSet F v` is even (`F` an even subgraph), `S ∆ flipSet F v` stays an even subset of `N(v)`. | — |
| `CFIBase.cfiFlip` | **The cycle-space gadget flip** on `CFIVertex H`: toggles endpoint parities along `F` (`e^b_{v→w} ↦ e^{b⊕F v w}_{v→w}`) and complements subsets (`a_S^v ↦ a_{S ∆ flipSet F v}^v`). | Definition (Phase 1) |
| `CFIBase.cfiFlip_involutive` | The gadget flip is an involution (`(S ∆ F) ∆ F = S`; `(b⊕c)⊕c = b`). | — |
| `CFIBase.cfiFlipEquiv` | The gadget flip as an `Equiv.Perm CFIVertex` (self-inverse). | Definition |
| `xor_eq_xor_iff` / `xor_ne_xor_iff` | Xor right-cancellation on `Bool` (`(a⊕c) = (b⊕c) ↔ a = b`, and the `≠` form). | private |
| `CFIBase.decide_mem_symmDiff_flipSet` | **Phase 2 bridge.** For `w ∈ N(v)`, `w ∈ S ∆ flipSet F v ↔ (w∈S) ⊕ F v w` — endpoint parity and subset membership flip together. | — |
| `CFIBase.cfiFlip_isAut` | **Phase 2 (the automorphism core).** For `F` an even subgraph that is symmetric (`F v w = F w v`), `cfiFlip F` preserves `cfiAdj` on every pair. Subset–endpoint: the `(w∈S)⊕b` invariant survives the joint flip; endpoint–endpoint bridge: the single edge `{v,w}` has one `F`-bit (symmetry), so `b₁=b₂` survives. | — |
| `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut` | **Phase 3.** The gadget flip transported to `adj`'s vertices `Fin n` via the CFI labelling `h.e`: `g = e⁻¹ ∘ cfiFlip F ∘ e`. | Definition |
| `IsCFI'.e_cfiFlipAut` | Transport identity `e (g v) = cfiFlip F (e v)` — `e` intertwines the `Fin n` and `CFIVertex` flips. | — |
| `IsCFI'.isAut_cfiFlipAut` | **Phase-3 deliverable.** For `F` an even symmetric subgraph, `cfiFlipAut F ∈ Aut(adj)` — an honest `IsAut … adj` (via `matching` + `cfiFlip_isAut`) the consumers (`configSwap_of_aut`, Tier-3a `hwit`) use. | — |
| `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut_involutive` | The lifted flip is an involution (needed where the decision pair must be *swapped*, `g a = b ∧ g b = a`). | — |
| `CFIBase.gadget` | **Phase 4.** The base vertex (gadget) of a CFI vertex. | Definition |
| `CFIBase.cfiFlip_eq_self_of_flipSet_empty` | **Locality.** If `F` has no edge at `x`'s gadget (`flipSet F (gadget x) = ∅`), the flip fixes `x` (`S ∆ ∅ = S`; empty flip set ⟹ `F v w = false` ⟹ parity unchanged). | — |
| `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut_eq_self_of_flipSet_empty` | Locality lifted to `Fin n`: `F` avoiding `i`'s gadget ⟹ `cfiFlipAut F` fixes `i`. | — |
| `IsCFI'.disjoint_support_cfiFlipAut` | **Phase-4 deliverable.** If every vertex of a committed set `T` lives in an `F`-free gadget, then `Disjoint T (cfiFlipAut F).support` — the exact `Disjoint (committed set) π.support` the path-fixing consumers (`hwit`, `configSwap`) require. | — |
| `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut_preserves_P` | **Phase 5.** The gadget flip preserves any `P` that *every* `adj`-automorphism preserves (the descent's profile/trivial `P`) — transported through `isAut_cfiFlipAut`. Honest scope: a component-moving flip preserves exactly the automorphism-invariant `P`'s. | — |
| `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut_pathFixing_witness` | **Phase-5 deliverable (Tier-3a B1 `hwit` shape).** Assembles Phases 3–5 + `g v = w` into `∃ π, IsAut π adj ∧ (∀ x u, P (π x)(π u) = P x u) ∧ Disjoint T π.support ∧ π v = w` — exactly what `Cascade.cascadeComposition_pathFixing`'s `hwit` consumes. | — |
| `triFlipEdges` / `triFlip_even` | **Phase-0 prototype:** `triangleBase`'s unique nontrivial even subgraph (all 3 edges; β=1) and its even-flip-set fact. | Definition / — |
| `triFlip_involutive_check` | Phase-0 smoke test: triangle gadget flip is an involution (`decide`, kernel, axiom-clean). | — |
| `triFlip_isAut_check` | **Phase-0 crux:** the triangle gadget flip preserves `cfiAdj` on all 18×18 pairs (`decide`) — validates cycle-flip-is-automorphism on the smallest case before the general Phase-2 proof. | — |
| `triFlip_nontrivial` | Phase-0 smoke test: the triangle gadget flip moves some vertex — a nontrivial `CFI(triangle)` automorphism. | — |

## ChainDescent/CascadeOracle.lean

The a-priori cascade-oracle Lean contract (plan: `docs/Archive/ChainDescent/chain-descent-cascade-oracle-lean-brief.md`). Builds axiom-clean (only `refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` + Lean foundationals), no `sorry`. Phase A = soundness/validity, Phase B = the completeness reduction (wired to the axiom-free orbit-recovery theorems), Phase C = the residual obligations: verdict iso-invariance is *discharged conditionally* (`verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete` — it reduces to localisation), and localisation is *split* into (1a) bounded-depth recoverability — **proved** on the cascade class (`RecoverableByDepth` + `recoverableByDepth_cfi`/`_scheme`, anchored by `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete`) — and (1b) intermediate-to-deep bridging, **open but not GI ∈ P** (cascade-class construction correctness). Only general-class completeness is the GI ∈ P obligation. §C.0 also proves the deferred-decisions foundation `real_stays_real`.

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `mono` | 59-68 | §C.0 Orbit monotonicity: an `Aut_{S'}`-orbit pair stays an orbit pair at every smaller individualized set `S ⊆ S'`, so a certified merge can be reused at shallower nodes. | — |
| `real_stays_real` | 70-78 | §C.0 Deferred-decisions foundation: a genuine decision (no orbit relation) at `S` is still genuine at every larger `S' ⊇ S`, so deferring a real decision never loses it. | — |
| `orbitPartition_of_support_disjoint` | 112-126 | §C.0.1 **Support backbone.** An automorphism that fixes the individualized set `S` pointwise and sends `v ↦ w` certifies that `v, w` share an `Aut_S`-orbit. | — |
| `exists_orbit_witness_of_aut` | 128-138 | §C.0.1 **Availability depth.** A symmetry of support size `s` keeps its orbit pair certifiable down to individualized sets of size `n − s` — full-support symmetries only at the root, transpositions almost to the leaves. | — |
| `CascadeOracleSpec` | 140-152 | The a-priori cascade-oracle interface: at an internal descent node, return either `none` or a verified automorphism merging two representatives. The cascade analogue of `LinearOracleSpec` (not leaf-gated). | Definition |
| `some_isAut` | 159-167 | Soundness: whatever permutation the oracle returns is guaranteed to be an automorphism of `adj`. | — |
| `OrbitMapSpec` | 169-181 | The oracle's soundness contract: every merge it returns is a genuine `Aut_D`-orbit pair — the property that makes pruning the merged branch safe. | Definition |
| `merged_sameCell` | 183-194 | A sound oracle only ever merges vertices that 1-WL already left in the same cell, so it never collapses across cells. | — |
| `OrbitRecoverableAt` | 216-225 | The orbit-recovery target at `S`: the `Aut_S`-orbit relation equals the 1-WL cell relation, so refinement computes orbits and a complete oracle exists. | Definition |
| `orbitRecoverable_of_cascade` | 227-235 | On the cascade class, orbits are recoverable at some set of size ≤ `k` — the general foundation behind every cascade-class oracle instance. | — |
| `orbitRecoverable_cfi` | 237-245 | Odd-degree CFI graphs are orbit-recoverable at depth ≤ `cfi_depth_bound h` (axiom-free). | — |
| `orbitRecoverable_scheme` | 247-257 | Rank-2, single-edge-class schurian scheme graphs are orbit-recoverable at depth 1 (axiom-free). | — |
| `CellsAreOrbits` | 259-272 | The genuinely-open half of orbit recovery: every same-cell pair is a real `Aut_S`-orbit pair. Holds at cascade and discretizing depth, fails at generic intermediate nodes — this predicate names the open localisation content. | Definition |
| `orbitRecoverableAt_iff_cellsAreOrbits` | 274-283 | Orbit recoverability is exactly `CellsAreOrbits` (the other half is unconditional), pinning localisation to a single implication. | — |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete` | 285-297 | **Recursion-bottom anchor.** At any discretizing depth `CellsAreOrbits` holds for free, so localisation is never GI-hard — the descent can always deepen to where cells = orbits. | — |
| `isAut_swap_of_twin` | 327-361 | A twin pair's transposition is an automorphism: if `v, w` have identical adjacency to every other vertex of a simple graph, `swap v w` preserves `adj`. Shared with the linear oracle's twin `ConfigSwap`. | — |
| `orbitPartition_swap_of_twin` | 363-428 | An order-undecided twin pair `v, w ∉ S` is an `Aut_S`-orbit pair at **any** individualized set, witnessed by the transposition `(v w)`. The reconstruction core behind the twin-endpoint and twin-cells results. | — |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_compl_card_le_two` | 430-544 | **Twin endpoint of the support spectrum.** When at most two vertices stay un-individualized (`|Sᶜ| ≤ 2`), `CellsAreOrbits` holds via the omitted pair's transposition; with `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete` it pins both ends. | — |
| `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells` | 546-602 | `CellsAreOrbits` at **arbitrary** support whenever every same-cell pair is an order-undecided twin — the genuine-twin / module abelian regime (not CFI, which has no twins). The twin-reconstructible slice of the open localisation obligation. | — |
| `orbitRecoverableAt_of_twin_cells` | 604-623 | Oracle-vocabulary form of `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells`: on the twin regime refinement computes the orbit partition at any node, with no depth bound. | — |
| `RecoverableByDepth` | 625-634 | Cascade-class membership for the oracle contract: there is a polynomially-bounded depth at which cells = orbits (the bound carries all the content). | Definition |
| `recoverableByDepth_of_cascade` | 636-642 | Cascading at depth `k` gives `RecoverableByDepth … k` — the cascade-class foundation in oracle-contract form. | — |
| `recoverableByDepth_cfi` | 644-650 | **(1a), proved for CFI** (axiom-free, odd-degree): recoverable by depth `cfi_depth_bound h` (≤ baseSize ≤ n/6). | — |
| `recoverableByDepth_scheme` | 652-664 | **(1a), proved for schemes** (axiom-free, rank 2 / `|J| = 1`): recoverable by depth 1, at the very node the oracle acts on. | — |
| `recoverableByDepth_univ` | 666-673 | Every graph is trivially recoverable by depth `n` (individualize everything), so only the *polynomial* depth bound is cascade-class content. | — |
| `CascadeComplete` | 680-687 | Completeness contract: the oracle certifies every genuine `Aut_D`-orbit pair; with soundness it then computes the orbit relation exactly. | Definition |
| `certifies_iff_orbit` | 689-703 | For a sound and complete cascade oracle, it returns `some` exactly on the pairs sharing an `Aut_D`-orbit. | — |
| `CellComplete` | 705-712 | The polynomial completeness contract: the oracle certifies every pair sharing a 1-WL cell (refinement-decidable). | Definition |
| `complete_of_cellComplete_recoverable` | 714-727 | **Key theorem.** At an orbit-recoverable node, certifying every same-cell pair already certifies every orbit — reducing orbit-completeness to a polynomial check. | — |
| `VerdictIsoInvariant` | 774-787 | Iso-invariance contract (strategy §15 gap 2): the oracle's verdict depends only on the iso-invariant 1-WL partition. Derivable — see `verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete`. | Definition |
| `cascadeComplete_of_localization` | 789-800 | Capstone: cell-completeness plus all-nodes recoverability yields `CascadeComplete`, naming the open localisation obligation as its hypotheses. | — |
| `cascadeComplete_of_cellsAreOrbits` | 802-813 | Capstone stated against the single open implication: cell-completeness plus `CellsAreOrbits` at every node yields `CascadeComplete`. | — |
| `verdictIsoInvariant_of_complete` | 815-830 | **Key theorem.** A sound, complete oracle at orbit-recoverable nodes is automatically iso-invariant, so iso-invariance is part of localisation rather than a separate obligation. | — |

## ChainDescent/LinearOracle.lean

The linear-oracle / abelian-stripping work (tractable-buildout B2; plan + status in `docs/chain-descent-linear-oracle.md` §8.2). Built on the §15.8 scaffolding (`DirAssignment`/`flipPair`/`LinearOracleSpec`/`LeafTwistSpec`/`canonAdj`). Builds axiom-clean (`refineStep`/`refineStep_iff` + foundationals), no `sorry`. **B2 soundness core DONE 2026-05-30:** §L.1 soundness anchor, §L.2 the *forced* candidate twist (rank rebasing — the construction is determined, not searched; the `canonAdj_rebase` bridge), §L.3 abelian `Z₂^d` structure. Remaining: `canonForm` lex-min tie (needs descent-with-pruning model), completeness, lifting twists to subgroup `N` (Part A).

### §L.1 — Soundness anchor (B2.1)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `RealizesFlip` | 52-61 | **Soundness anchor.** The relation "twist `t` relabels branch `σ`'s leaf to the flipped branch `flipPair σ a b`'s leaf" — the `LeafTwistSpec` conclusion with the partner branch pinned to the flip, i.e. the pruning justification. | Definition |
| `TwistWitness` | 63-83 | The verified data a twist discovery returns: the decided pair `(a,b)`, the candidate permutation `t`, its `IsAut` proof (the §4.5 edge-check, sole soundness anchor), and a `RealizesFlip` proof. | Structure |
| `twistOracle` | 85-95 | A concrete `LinearOracleSpec` parameterised by an abstracted `discover` function (C#-side canonical-id matching); returns the verified automorphism from a `TwistWitness`, `none` otherwise. Verification lives inside the witness, so every output is a genuine automorphism. | Definition |
| `twistOracle_leafTwist` | 97-116 | **Key theorem (B2.1 discharge).** `twistOracle` satisfies `LeafTwistSpec`, with the flipped branch as the explicit witness `σ' = flipPair σ` (sharper than the bare existential) — closing the pruning-justification contract for any sound discovery. | — |

### §L.2 — The forced candidate twist (B2.2 + most of B2.3)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `relabelMatrix_labelledAdj` | 141-150 | Relabelling composes: `relabelMatrix t (labelledAdj s adj) = labelledAdj (t * s) adj` — the `Equiv.Perm` group action on labelled matrices. | — |
| `canonAdj_eq_labelledAdj` | 152-157 | `canonAdj σ = labelledAdj (rankPerm π_σ) adj` for any discreteness proof; holds by `rfl`. | — |
| `canonAdj_rebase` | 159-174 | **The rebasing bridge.** Relabelling `σ`'s canonical leaf by the rank rebasing `rankPerm π_{σ'} * (rankPerm π_σ)⁻¹` yields `σ'`'s leaf; the flip is the `σ' = flipPair σ` instance. | — |
| `branch_discrete` | 176-182 | A branch's warm-refined colouring is discrete at a leaf, derived exactly as `canonAdj` derives it so the rank permutations match definitionally. | — |
| `candidateTwist` | 184-192 | **The forced candidate twist** for decision `(a,b)`: the rank rebasing `rankPerm π_flip * (rankPerm π_σ)⁻¹`. Always realises the flip; the twist is determined, not searched. | Definition, `noncomputable` |
| `candidateTwist_realizesFlip` | 194-201 | The forced candidate always realises the flip — the construction is forced, with no ambiguity. | — |
| `candidateTwist_unique` | 203-215 | **Determinacy.** The candidate is the unique permutation rank-aligning `σ` to the flipped branch — the leaf-level iso-invariance gate, making twist discovery deterministic in iso-invariant rank data. | — |
| `twistWitness_of_isAut` | 217-234 | The oracle reduces to one check: a verified-automorphism forced candidate yields a complete `TwistWitness`. Discovery is a single decidable edge-check. | Definition, `noncomputable` |
| `canonicalTwistOracle` | 235-249 | **The canonical twist oracle.** A fully concrete `LinearOracleSpec`: for the selected pair, compute the forced candidate and return it iff it verifies as an automorphism. The only abstracted piece is pair selection (soundness-irrelevant). | Definition, `noncomputable` |
| `canonicalTwistOracle_leafTwist` | 251-259 | **Key theorem.** `canonicalTwistOracle` satisfies `LeafTwistSpec` (it is a `twistOracle`) — a concrete verified linear oracle, sound by construction. | — |

### §L.3 — Abelian structure (B2.4, partial)

| Name | Line | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| `candidateTwist_flip_inv` | 282-291 | **`Z₂` involution.** The forced candidate for the flip-back is the inverse of the candidate for the flip; with `flipPair_comm` this is the elementary-abelian `Z₂^d` structure of the residual. | — |

### §L.4 — Completeness / effectiveness (when the oracle fires)

Characterizes *when* the oracle fires and proves firing is semantically justified. The
oracle is complete exactly on the **abelian regime** (forced candidate ∈ Aut) — the
calculator §6 boundary; the general converse fails (conjugation gap). The
abelian-sufficiency lemma (forced candidate IsAut for genuine abelian flips, via
`warm_6_2` rank machinery) is the open core scoped in the §L.4 doc-comment.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `candidateTwist_mul_rankPerm` | 319-327 | The forced candidate satisfies the rank-alignment equation `candidate · π_σ = π_flip` (the inverse cancels). | — |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_aligned` | 329-344 | **Firing characterisation.** The forced candidate is an automorphism iff some automorphism is rank-aligned (`g · π_σ = π_flip`) — so the whole completeness question is "does a rank-aligned automorphism exist?" | — |
| `RealizableFlip` | 346-352 | The decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry: some automorphism realises the flip (the two branches are isomorphic) — what pruning should require. | Definition |
| `realizableFlip_of_isAut_candidateTwist` | 354-365 | **Firing is semantically justified.** When the forced candidate verifies, the branches are genuinely `Aut(adj)`-equivalent (the candidate is the witness) — pruning reflects a real symmetry. | — |
| `canonicalTwistOracle_isSome_iff` | 367-383 | **Key theorem.** Given the pair selector returns `(a,b)`, the oracle fires iff the forced candidate is an automorphism — the entire completeness question is one decidable edge-check. | — |
| `candidateTwist_flipBack_isAut` | 385-396 | **`Z₂`-direction consistency.** If the forced candidate for `σ → flip` verifies, so does the candidate for the flip-back — the oracle prunes both directions of a genuine `Z₂` decision consistently. | — |

### §L.5 — Toward abelian sufficiency (partial)

The open core of completeness — *forced candidate ∈ Aut for abelian decisions* — needs
gadget-level rank-alignment (at a leaf both branches are discrete, so `warm_6_2`'s
partition equality is vacuous; the content is in the rank order). Provable progress:

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `rankPerm_comp` | 421-441 | **Rank reindexing.** `rankPerm (χ ∘ e) = rankPerm χ · e` — relabelling conjugate-shifts the rank permutation, the precise reason colouring-alignment yields a conjugate of the realizing automorphism rather than the forced candidate (the conjugation gap). | — |
| `candidateTwist_eq_one_of_rankPerm_eq` | 443-454 | **Absorbed decision.** Equal leaf rank permutations force the candidate to be the identity — the degenerate end of the abelian regime. | — |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_of_rankPerm_eq` | 456-464 | The absorbed decision fires: the forced candidate (the identity) is an automorphism. | — |

### §L.7 — The CFI bridge (M1b): candidate as a conjugate of a graph automorphism

Now that `refineStep` is concrete, the cross-config transport (`§16.2b` in ChainDescent.lean)
lets us express the forced candidate via a *real* automorphism. A **config-swap** `g` carries the
σ-branch config onto the flip-branch config; it forces `π_σ = π_flip · g`, so the candidate is the
`π_σ`-conjugate of `g⁻¹`. This reduces the opaque `IsAut candidate adj` to the structural gadget
rank-alignment, isolating the genuine CFI nut (shared with Tier-3a B1 `hwit`): (1) a config-swap
exists, (2) its `π_σ`-conjugate is an automorphism.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `vertexRank_comp` | 603-621 | `vertexRank (χ ∘ g) v = vertexRank χ (g v)` — a pure `Finset.card` reindex along `g`. | — |
| `ConfigSwap` | 623-635 | A config-swap for decision `(a,b)`: a graph automorphism carrying the σ-branch configuration onto the flip-branch configuration (fixes `χι`, sends `σ.σ` to `(flipPair σ).σ`). For CFI, the gadget twist swapping the decided pair. | Structure |
| `configSwap_rankPerm` / `_flip` | The leaf rank perms differ by `g`: `π_σ = π_flip · g` (resp. `π_flip = π_σ · g⁻¹`), from transport + `vertexRank_comp`. | axiom-light |
| `configSwap_rankPerm_flip` | 654-661 | `π_flip = π_σ · g⁻¹` — the rearrangement of `configSwap_rankPerm`. | — |
| `candidateTwist_eq_conjugate` | 663-673 | **The rank-space reduction.** Given a config-swap `g`, the forced candidate is the `π_σ`-conjugate of `g⁻¹` (`candidateTwist = π_σ · g⁻¹ · π_σ⁻¹`) — the opaque rebasing exposed as a conjugate of a genuine automorphism. | — |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_conjugate` | 675-686 | **The reduction.** `IsAut candidate adj ↔ IsAut (π_σ · g⁻¹ · π_σ⁻¹) adj` — the rank-space firing obligation is exactly the gadget rank-alignment, the concrete nut shared with Tier-3a B1. | — |

**§L.7b — vertex-model soundness (Approach C, the faithful C# model).** A config-swap is a real
graph automorphism, so both branches give the *same canonical leaf* — no rank-alignment needed. This
is the soundness the C# `TwistConstruction` actually uses (it verifies a vertex automorphism, not the
rank rebasing).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `canonAdj_eq_of_configSwap` | 697-712 | **Equal canonical leaves.** A config-swap implies both branches produce the identical canonical leaf — the vertex-model soundness statement (pruning the flip branch loses nothing), needing no rank-alignment. | — |
| `realizableFlip_of_configSwap` | 714-728 | A config-swap implies `RealizableFlip` (identity witness, since the leaves coincide) — the decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry with no rank-alignment obligation. | — |

**§L.8 — CFI completeness: config-swap from a swapping automorphism (M1c step 3, the cascade-1b bridge).**
*Where a config-swap comes from.* A swapping automorphism `g` (`g a = b`, `g b = a`) is exactly an
`OrbitPartition adj P S a b` witness specialised to the size-2 decision cell — the cascade oracle's
currency. So linear-oracle CFI completeness reduces to the **shared cascade-1b** obligation
(bounded-depth half `recoverableByDepth_cfi` proved; decision-node-depth bridge open, *not* `GI∈P`).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `configSwap_of_aut` | 770-811 | **General constructor (the `hwit` entry point).** *Any* swapping automorphism `g` (`g a = b`, `g b = a`) that fixes `χι` and preserves `σ.σ` *off the flip pair* (`σ.σ (g v)(g u) = σ.σ v u` for `(v,u) ∉ {(a,b),(b,a)}`) is a `ConfigSwap` — `g` need **not** be a transposition (may move the whole coupled component). Removes the config-swap *packaging* from the open content: once the CFI gadget twist `g` and its off-pair `σ`-action are known, the `ConfigSwap` is built with no rank-alignment. | Definition |
| `configSwap_of_swap` | 812-872 | **Closed instance (the `Z₂` twin-swap).** A σ-cell-coherent transposition automorphism (`g` swaps `a,b`, fixes the rest and `χι`) is a `ConfigSwap` — the simplest genuine abelian decision. Now a thin specialisation of `configSwap_of_aut` (transposition ⇒ off-pair preservation = σ-cell-coherence). | Definition |
| `configSwap_of_twin` | 874-893 | **The twin → config-swap bridge.** An (adj, σ)-twin decision pair (adjacency-twin on a simple graph plus σ-cell-coherent, `χι a = χι b`) admits a `ConfigSwap` via the transposition `(a b)` — the linear-oracle analog of `cellsAreOrbits_of_twin_cells`, both oracles firing on the same twin/module class through one shared lemma. Not CFI (which has no twins). | Definition |
| `ConfigSwapRecoverable` | 895-903 | **Decision-node recoverability** (the named cascade-1b obligation for the linear oracle): every leaf decision admits a config-swap. The graph-level analog of `AbelianSufficiencyHolds`; open discharge `configSwapRecoverable_of_cfi` is downstream. | Definition |
| `canonAdj_eq_of_configSwapRecoverable` | 904-915 | **Capstone (pruning soundness).** Config-swap-recoverability implies both branches give the identical canonical leaf at every decision — reducing the oracle's effectiveness to the single `ConfigSwapRecoverable` hypothesis. | — |
| `realizableFlip_of_configSwapRecoverable` | 917-928 | **Capstone (real symmetry).** Config-swap-recoverability implies every leaf decision is a genuine `Aut(adj)` symmetry — vertex-model completeness, no rank-alignment needed. | — |

**§L.9 — CFI gadget twist fires the oracle (Phase 6a: wiring the Stage-3 cycle-space flip).** The
Stage-3 gadget flip (`CFI.lean §15`, `IsCFI'.cfiFlipAut`) is now constructed; this section wires it into
`configSwap_of_aut` and reduces `ConfigSwapRecoverable` for CFI to the existence of the right cycle `F`
per decision.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `configSwap_of_cfiFlipAut` | **The CFI gadget twist is a config-swap** (unconditional bridge). `configSwap_of_aut` instantiated with `g := cfiFlipAut F` (an `Aut(adj)` involution by `isAut_cfiFlipAut`): if the flip swaps `(a,b)`, fixes `χι`, and carries `σ` off the pair, it is a `ConfigSwap`. The concrete soundness — the vertex-space gadget twist (the C#'s witness) fires the oracle, no rank-alignment. | Definition |
| `CFIGadgetFlippable` | **The named cascade-1b residual.** Every leaf decision admits an even-symmetric cycle `F` whose gadget flip swaps `(a,b)`, fixes `χι`, carries `σ` off the pair. Commits the CFI witness to the gadget-flip mechanism (matching the C#); the open content is purely `F`'s existence per decision (cascade-1b). | Definition |
| `configSwapRecoverable_of_cfi` | **`ConfigSwapRecoverable` for CFI via the gadget flip.** `CFIGadgetFlippable h → ConfigSwapRecoverable` — the discharge reduced to its irreducible combinatorial core (the decision-local even cycle's existence). Feeds the capstones ⟹ oracle fires on every CFI decision. | — |

Open (not a `sorry`): **`CFIGadgetFlippable`** — that the decision-local even cycle `F` *exists* for every
decision (the flip is built and proven sound; what remains is the cycle through the decision edge, local
to the decided gadget). Its three per-decision obligations (swap `(a,b)`, fix `χι`, carry `σ` off the
pair) are the descent-coherence content of cascade-1b — the decision-node-depth half, shared with the
cascade oracle, *not* `GI∈P`. Reducing them further (`χι` via partition-invariance, `σ` via locality +
σ-cell-coherence) is follow-on groundwork.

Transport chain it builds on (ChainDescent.lean `§16.2b`): `signature_transport`, `sigKey_transport`,
`refineStep_transport`, `iterate_refineStep_transport`, `warmRefine_transport` — cross-config (two
`(P,χ)` related by an automorphism), the value-level generalisation of the `*_invariant_of_isAut`
chain, newly provable because `refineStep` is concrete. All axiom-light.

### §L.6 — Relativized completeness (the retargeting)

The general completeness statement ("forced candidate fires whenever the branches are
isomorphic") *provably* cannot close — a realizing aut agrees with the forced candidate only
up to a conjugate of `Aut(adj)` (`rankPerm_comp`), the split-or-Johnson wall *by design*, and
the **same gap the a-priori cascade oracle carries** (`CascadeOracle.lean` §4.3). The fix is
the cascade oracle's **Phase-B move**: relativize completeness to the recoverable/abelian
class and reduce it to orbit recovery. This scaffold names the relativized target and isolates
the one open obligation (`AbelianSufficiencyHolds` on the CFI class — the leaf-level instance
of orbit recovery, the same nut as Tier-3a B1's `hwit`).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `RankAligned` | 501-509 | The algebraic firing condition: a rank-aligned automorphism exists (`∃ g ∈ Aut(adj), g · π_σ = π_flip`). The oracle fires exactly when this holds. | Definition |
| `isAut_candidateTwist_iff_rankAligned` | 511-519 | **Interface.** The forced candidate is an automorphism iff `RankAligned` — the completeness question restated against the named predicate. | — |
| `AbelianSufficiency` | 521-531 | **The per-decision relativized completeness target.** `RealizableFlip → IsAut candidate`: if the flip is a real symmetry then the forced candidate verifies. False in the non-abelian regime (the wall); the claim to discharge on the abelian/cascade class. | Definition |
| `oracleFires_of_abelianSufficiency` | 533-548 | **Capstone (what suffices).** `AbelianSufficiency` plus a real symmetry implies the oracle fires — the linear-oracle analog of cascade's `cascadeComplete_of_localization`. | — |
| `abelianSufficiency_of_rankPerm_eq` | 550-561 | **Non-vacuous closed instance.** The absorbed decision is abelian-sufficient (candidate `= 1 ∈ Aut` outright) — validates the scaffold against a real instance. | — |
| `AbelianSufficiencyHolds` | 563-571 | The graph-level discharge target: every leaf decision is abelian-sufficient. Open obligation `abelianSufficiencyHolds_of_cfi` is downstream (via `theorem_1_HOR_cfi_oddDeg`, the same nut as Tier-3a B1's `hwit`). | Definition |
| `oracleFires_of_abelianSufficiencyHolds` | 573-587 | **Graph-level capstone.** `AbelianSufficiencyHolds` implies the oracle fires at every leaf decision that is a real symmetry — relativized completeness on the abelian class. | — |

## ChainDescent/Group.lean

Part A (A1–A3) of `docs/chain-descent-tier3-tractable-buildout.md` — the group object
the orbit-recovery program deliberately avoided, now needed for Tier-3 vocabulary
(`H₀ ⊵ … ⊵ H_k`, quotient graphs). Pure glue over Mathlib group theory + the existing
`IsAut` lemmas; **no `refineStep`** dependency (axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
A4 (the quotient *graph* `G/H` + cell = quotient-vertex lemma) is **not** here — it is the
medium-risk Mathlib gap gating B1.

### A1 — `Aut(G)` as a group

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `AutGroup adj` | §A1 **The automorphism group.** `{π | IsAut π adj}` as a `Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` — the group object Tier-3 vocabulary (`H₀ ⊵ … ⊵ H_k`, quotient graphs) is stated over. | Definition |

| `mem_orbit_autGroup_iff_orbitPartition` | 111-125 | §A2 **The orbit bridge.** Under `P`-invariance, `v`'s `AutGroup`-orbit coincides with the root relation `OrbitPartition adj P ∅` — the group-level reading of the support backbone's root case. | — |

### A3 — Normal subgroup chains

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `LayerChain adj` | §A3 A finite descending chain `AutGroup adj = layer 0 ⊵ … ⊵ layer len = ⊥`, each layer relatively normal in its predecessor — the `H₀ ⊵ … ⊵ H_k` substrate Tier-3a (B1) reasons over. | Structure |
| `LayerChain.trivial` | §A3 **The trivial chain** `AutGroup adj ⊵ ⊥` (length 1); witnesses `LayerChain` is inhabited. | Definition |

### A4 — quotient graph + cell = quotient-vertex

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `orbitSetoid adj P S` | §A4 The `Aut_S`-orbit relation `OrbitPartition adj P S` packaged as a `Setoid` from its proved `refl`/`symm`/`trans`. | Definition |
| `OrbitQuotient adj P S` | §A4 **The quotient vertex set** `V(G)/Aut_S` — the vertices of the quotient graph. | `abbrev` |
| `orbitMk` / `orbitMk_eq_iff` | The quotient map `v ↦ ⟦v⟧`; `orbitMk v = orbitMk w ↔ OrbitPartition adj P S v w`. | Definition / `Quotient.eq` |
| `cell_iff_orbitMk_eq` | 226-242 | §A4 **The cell = quotient-vertex lemma.** Under `CellsAreOrbits`, two vertices share a 1-WL cell of `(G, S)` iff they are the same quotient vertex — the correspondence B1's cascade-composition induction steps through. | — |
| `QuotientAdjCompatible` | 246-254 | §A4 **Quotient-adjacency compatibility.** The condition that `adj v w` is constant on `Aut_S`-orbit pairs — exactly when a simple induced adjacency on the quotient is well-defined (holds at discreteness, fails for coarser `S`). | Definition |
| `quotientAdj` / `quotientAdj_mk` | The induced adjacency on `OrbitQuotient`, well-defined under `QuotientAdjCompatible` (via `Quotient.lift₂`); `quotientAdj h ⟦v⟧ ⟦w⟧ = adj.adj v w` (`rfl`). | Definition / `@[simp]` |
| `quotientAdjCompatible_of_discrete` | 269-280 | §A4 At discreteness the quotient graph is always well-defined (orbits are singletons) — the recursion-bottom anchor, paralleling `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete`. | — |
| `orbitPartition_empty_iff_orbitRel` | 290-302 | §A4 The root orbit relation `OrbitPartition adj P ∅` equals the `AutGroup` `MulAction` orbit relation (under `P`-invariance) — the relational form of the A2 orbit bridge, symmetrised for `orbitRel`. | — |
| `orbitQuotientEquivAutGroup` | 304-312 | §A4 **The root quotient is `V(G)/Aut(G)`.** Under `P`-invariance, `OrbitQuotient adj P ∅` is equivalent to the `MulAction` orbit quotient of `AutGroup adj`, tying A4's relational quotient back to A1/A2's group object. | Definition |

## ChainDescent/Cascade.lean

B1 (Tier 3a cascade composition) of `docs/chain-descent-tier3-tractable-buildout.md`,
Phases A + C. Build plan: `docs/chain-descent-tier3a-b1-build-plan.md`. The headline
"depths add" theorem, **conditional on the per-layer transfer** (`LayerStep`, = paper
§4.2.5, discharged in the not-yet-built Phase D). Stays on `Fin n` (no quotient
re-typing) by telescoping cumulative individualization sets. Axiom-clean (standard
basis; `refineStep` via `warmRefine`).

### Phase A — interface

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `IsBase adj P T` | **Phase A interface.** `T` is a *base* of the `P`-preserving automorphism group: its pointwise stabilizer is trivial, so the `Aut_T`-orbit relation is equality — the chain's bottom `H_k = {1}`. | Definition |
| `LayerStep adj P T S` | **Phase A interface — the per-layer transfer obligation.** `CellsAreOrbits T → CellsAreOrbits (T ∪ S)`: individualizing the increment `S` brings cells down to `Aut_{T∪S}`-orbits (paper §4.2.5 transferred to `G`). The contract the composition induction consumes; discharged in Phase D. | Definition |
| (cascade-class predicate) | `RecoverableByDepth adj P bound` (in `CascadeOracle.lean`) — Tier-1 (`recoverableByDepth_cfi`) / Tier-2 (`recoverableByDepth_scheme`) instances already proved. | (existing) |

### Phase C — composition theorem

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `discrete_of_cellsAreOrbits_base` | 69-76 | **(C1) Finish.** At a base `T` where cells already coincide with `Aut_T`-orbits, warm refinement at `T` is `Discrete` — the cascade reaching full canonization. | — |
| `cellsAreOrbits_compose` | 78-91 | **(C2) Composition induction.** From layer 1's unconditional `CellsAreOrbits` at `T 0` and a `LayerStep` at each subsequent layer, `CellsAreOrbits` holds at the final cumulative set `T k`. | — |
| `cumulative_card_le` | 93-99 | **Depths add (cardinality).** The cumulative individualization set `⋃_{i≤k} S i` has size at most `Σ_{i≤k} f i` when each layer is bounded by its depth `f i`. | — |
| `cascadeComposition` | 101-113 | **Theorem 3a (cascade composition) — headline, conditional form.** Cumulative sets with layer-1 recoverability, per-layer transfer steps, and the final set a base ⟹ warm refinement at `T k` reaches the discrete partition; with `cumulative_card_le` the cascade depth is `≤ Σ fᵢ`. Conditional on the `hstep` obligations (= §4.2.5, Phase D). | — |
| `cascadeComposition_single` | 121-124 | **Single-layer sanity check (k = 0).** One cascade-class layer that is a base reaches discreteness — recovers the Tier-1/Tier-2 orbit-recovery theorems as the composition's base case. | — |

### Phase D — discharging `LayerStep` (the §4.2.5 transfer), intrinsic route

Approach B (build-plan §3): stay on `Fin n`, reduce `LayerStep` to a witness-upgrade via
**set-monotonicity** of warm refinement (reusing `refineStep_iff`); the materialized-quotient
route was rejected (`refineStep` axiomatic, no cross-size API).

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `Refines χ₁ χ₂` | `χ₁` refines `χ₂`: the partition of `χ₁` is finer (`χ₁ a = χ₁ b → χ₂ a = χ₂ b`). The partition order used for warm-refinement monotonicity. | Definition |
| `signature_refines` | 142-163 | **Crux of warm-refinement monotonicity.** If `χ₁` refines `χ₂`, equal `χ₁`-signatures give equal `χ₂`-signatures, since `signature χ₂` is the coarsening of `signature χ₁`. | — |
| `iterate_refineStep_refines` / `warmRefine_refines_initial` | warm refinement monotone in the initial colouring's partition order. | axiom-light |
| `individualizedColouring_refines` | 189-201 | Individualizing a superset gives a finer initial colouring: `T ⊆ T'` ⟹ `individualizedColouring n T'` refines `individualizedColouring n T`. | — |
| `warmRefine_indiv_mono` | 203-211 | **Set-monotonicity (the payoff).** Same `(T ∪ S)`-cell ⟹ same `T`-cell: 1-WL is monotone in the individualization set. The load-bearing lemma the docs had mis-cited as `warmRefine_refines`. | — |
| `WitnessUpgrade adj P T S` | **The genuine §4.2.5 content.** For `v, w` in the same `Aut_T`-orbit and the same `(T ∪ S)`-cell, the orbit relation upgrades to `Aut_{T∪S}`. The Phase-D interface predicate. | Definition |
| `layerStep_of_witnessUpgrade` | 225-232 | **The reduction — where Phase C meets the per-layer content.** A `WitnessUpgrade` discharges a `LayerStep`, via set-monotonicity then `CellsAreOrbits T` then the upgrade. | — |
| `layerStep_empty` / `layerStep_subset` / `layerStep_of_cellsAreOrbits` / `layerStep_of_discrete` | Trivial real instances: no-op layer (`S = ∅`), `S ⊆ T`, independently-recoverable target, and the discretizing recursion-bottom. | axiom-light |
| `witnessUpgrade_of_pathFixing` | 257-272 | **Bridge to harvested generators.** If every same-orbit, same-cell pair admits a `P`-preserving automorphism whose support avoids `T ∪ S` (fixes the committed path) and sends `v ↦ w`, the witness-upgrade holds — exactly what the cascade/linear oracles produce. | — |

### Step 5 — the synthesis (Theorem 3a reduced to harvested generators)

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `cascadeComposition_pathFixing` | 291-312 | **Theorem 3a, reduced to harvested path-fixing generators.** Cumulative sets by increments, layer-1 recoverable, every layer's residual symmetry realized by path-fixing automorphisms (`hwit`), and the final set a base ⟹ discrete warm refinement at `T k`. Reduces all of Theorem 3a to the single hypothesis of per-layer path-fixing witness existence. | — |
| `cascadeComposition_twoLayer` | 314-329 | **Smallest genuine composition.** An outer cascade-class layer at `T₀`, an inner path-fixing layer with increment `S`, and the union a base ⟹ discreteness — the `CFI(scheme)` / `Scheme(CFI)` shape. | — |
