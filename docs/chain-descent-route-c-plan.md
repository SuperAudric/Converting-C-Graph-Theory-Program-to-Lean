# Route C — the constructive form-recovery route to a POLYNOMIAL forms-graph canonizer

> **What this is.** The self-contained build plan for **Route C**: proving the affine forms-graph residue is
> canonized in **polynomial** time by *recovering the defining algebraic structure* (the form/geometry) from the
> abstract graph and then using its **known** automorphism group — instead of driving Weisfeiler–Leman refinement to
> orbits. Route C **sidesteps the node-4 WL-dimension wall** that closed the direct recovery route
> ([`chain-descent-recovery-route.md`](./chain-descent-recovery-route.md) §9.8.9). This doc is the staging point: a
> fresh reader should be able to read it and build forward. It carries the plan, the knowledge foundation, the exact
> names of the preexisting lemmas Route C rides on, and the probe evidence.
>
> **Relation to the other docs.** The SEAL (correctness disjunction `reachesRigidOrCameron`) is **already banked at
> quasipoly** and is *not* Route C's job. The direct WL/poly routes (A/B, `bᵢ=1` via `ColorRefinesGramK`) **STALLED**
> at the node-4 wall — full verdict in the recovery doc §9.8.9. Route C is the **bounded, guaranteed-poly alternative**
> that route pointed to. The forms-graph plan ([`chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md`](./chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md))
> §11.4/§11.5 has the per-family (alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits / char-2) analysis this doc's architecture generalizes.

## STATUS (read first)

**Where Route C stands (2026-07-04) — handoff snapshot.** **★ ALL FOUR FORM FAMILIES ARE NOW SEALED** (affine-polar,
alternating `Alt(5,q)`, half-spin, Suzuki–Tits). **★ SUZUKI IS NOW CITATION-FREE (2026-07-04):** the old scoped
citation `SuzukiFormsDetermine` is **discharged** — `separates` is proved outright by second-derivative recovery on
an enlarged base (see "Suzuki" below), so `reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki` carries **no citation and no `hσ`**. So
three families rest on one exact scoped citation each (`NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` / `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily`),
and Suzuki rests on none. The Route-C **Lean spine is fully assembled and axiom-clean** (`ScratchRouteC.lean`, ~100
decls, all `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, NOT in `build.sh` — verify: `lake env lean
ChainDescent/ScratchRouteC.lean`, exit 0). The remaining work is **not another family** — it is the **§9
post-four-seals combine** (four seals → one correctness object) + the **C# runtime** + optionally promoting the
remaining scoped citations to full Lean proofs. Landed:
- **The single-form spine (affine-polar):** F1+A1 (C#, confirmed vs the real harness) → A3 brick 1 (isometry scheme
  refines the graph) → discretize at a spanning base (`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning`) → **F4** iso-invariance
  (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant`). Rests on ONE exact scoped citation, `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` (below).
- **F2 (`q=pᵉ` Frobenius/ΓL seam):** semilinear iso-invariance (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant_semilinear`),
  rests on the cited `ConePreservingCollineationIsSemiSimilitude` (fundamental thm of projective geometry).
- **F3 the engine interface (`IFormStructure`):** `FormAdapter` + `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron` (any adapter ⟹
  the seal). **Instance 1 (affine-polar) `affinePolarAdapter` ✅. Instance 2 (alternating `Alt(5,q)`) ✅ SEALED**
  (`reachesRigidOrCameron_alternating`, via the multi-quadric engine `multiFormAdapter`/`coords_determine_multi` +
  the concrete Plücker sub-Pfaffians `plucker_hjoint`) — first non-quadratic family. **Instance 3 (half-spin) ✅
  SEALED** (`reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin`, via the 10 validated D₅ spinor quadrics `S0..S9` + `spinor_hjoint` +
  `multiFormAdapter`; brick-1 `halfSpin_refines_coneScheme`; full instance-1 parity). **Instance 4 (Suzuki) ✅ SEALED
  + CITATION-FREE (2026-07-04)** — `reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki` via the 5 σ-twisted ovoid forms + the
  `GF(q)^4↔𝔽₂^d` module bridge (`suzukiAdapter`); `separates` PROVED by the second-derivative recovery identities
  (`SF0_recover` etc. + `suzukiForms_determine`) on the enlarged base `{0,eᵢ,eⱼ,eᵢ+eⱼ}` (8 pts) — **no citation, no
  `hσ`**. **⟹ ALL FOUR FORM FAMILIES SEALED** (three modulo one scoped citation, Suzuki modulo none).
- **Multi-quadric bridges (NEW 2026-07-03, axiom-clean) — brings the multi-form families to full instance-1
  parity.** Previously the `multiFormAdapter` families (alternating, half-spin) carried only the *seal* leg, not
  the *refinement* + *iso-invariance* legs the single-quadratic instance has. Both now supplied GENERICALLY over
  the form family: **brick-1-multi** `multiIsometryScheme_refines_coneScheme` (the recovered joint-isometry scheme
  `⨅ₖ O(Q_k)` refines the *graph-intrinsic* cone-stabilizer scheme `jointConeStab Qs` — cleaner than the
  single-form case, since the cone stabilizer is defined from the connection set, not a form-defined group) and
  **F4-multi** `recoveredFamily_colouring_equivariant` + `recoveredFamily_partition_isoInvariant` (a graph iso
  transports the value-tuple colouring by a global INJECTIVE `Φ`, so the colour partition is iso-invariant; `Φ`
  is the multi-form replacement for the single-form scalar `μ`; rests on the carried scoped citation
  `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily`, the multi-form sibling of `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm`). Factored the generic
  `affineScheme_refines_of_le` (`H ≤ G ⟹` finer; `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` is now its corollary);
  concrete `alternating_refines_coneScheme` / `halfSpin_refines_coneScheme` confirm the bridge fires on the real
  Plücker / spinor families. **⟹ alternating AND half-spin both at full instance-1 parity.**
- **Both review-flagged items resolved:** the classical carry is **discharged as an exact scoped citation**
  (`NondegQuadricDeterminesForm`); the **meta-poly bootstrapping is assessed sound** (§7a — global coordinatization,
  not the node-4 wall in disguise).

**▶ C# BUILD IN PROGRESS (2026-07-04) — C1a + C1b LANDED, all tests green.**
- **C1a `RecoverFormFamily`** (added to `QuadraticFormRecovery.cs`): generalizes A1 from `kernel[0]` (one quadratic) to
  the whole degree-2 **vanishing-space basis** (`RecoveredFormFamily{Basis[][], EvaluateAll, OnCone}`). Test
  `RouteCFormFamilyProbe.cs` (6/6): multi-quadric Cayley graphs (F₃⁴/F₅⁴/F₃⁶, VanishDim 2–4) reconstruct with **0
  mismatches** (valid because S := joint zero of chosen quadrics ⟹ `Z(V)=S∪{0}` exactly), + single-quadric consistency
  with A1 on VO±₄.
- **C1b `ClassicalGroupGenerators` + `ClassicalSimilitude` (the load-bearing piece)** (new files): builds
  `affineG(similitudeGroup Q)` generators = translations + orthogonal reflections `x↦x−(B(x,a)/Q(a))a` (Cartan–Dieudonné)
  + scalar scalings + **the non-square-factor similitude** (via congruence-diagonalization → factor-ν block map). Test
  `RouteCGroupProbe.cs`: **order-check EXACT at n=81 both types** — `built.Order == harvested |Aut|` (VO⁺₄(3)=186624,
  VO⁻₄(3)=233280), the executable form of `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG`. **KEY FINDING (predicted):** without the
  non-square similitude the built group is the index-2 subgroup (ratio exactly 2 = [F_p*:squares]); the similitude
  closes it. **SIFTING LIMITATION:** the order-check is exact at n=81 but Schreier–Sims *without sifting* does not scale
  the `Order` computation past ~n=81 with the full reflection set (~120 gens at n=625) — a `PermutationGroup` deferred
  concern, NOT a C1b-correctness issue; the *construction* scales fine (n=2401, 356 gens, all stabilise, fast). Closed
  form `|affineG^ε₄(q)| = q⁴·2q²(q²−ε)(q²−1)(q−1)` validated == harvested at n=81.
- **C2 `FormsGraphClassifier`** (new file): strong-regularity gate + **constructive** affine-polar detection
  (valency = VO^ε isotropic count `(qᵐ−ε)(qᵐ⁻¹+ε)`, confirmed by the recovered quadric reconstructing the graph) +
  Suzuki SRG(4096,455,6,56) fingerprint. Test `RouteCClassifyProbe.cs` (6/6): classifies VO±₄(3,5) with correct
  `(p,m,ε)`; non-SR / empty graphs → Unknown (misclassification is SAFE by design). Returns `Unknown` for
  alternating/half-spin (recovery = future multi-form track).
- **C3 `RouteCCanonicalizer` + the option-ii orderer wire** (new file + `CanonGraphOrdererChainDescent.EnableRouteC`,
  default OFF): canonicalizes a forms-graph residue via the **recovered algebraic invariant** `(q,m,ε)` (the form's
  iso-type is a complete invariant ⟹ canonical graph = standard VO^ε, `|Aut|` = closed form). Wire reuses the single
  descent's harvested group (`RecognizeFromResult`, no double-descent), returns the standard graph when recognized else
  the descent's lex-min. Test `RouteCCanonicalizeProbe.cs`: **END-TO-END ISO-STABILITY** — VO±₄(3) and 3 random
  scrambles recover the SAME `(q,m,ε)`, `|Aut|`, and canonical adjacency, both via the canonicalizer directly AND via
  the public orderer `Run` API. **KEY FINDING:** the wire's *d-scaling* payoff is gated on **C4** — recognition still
  needs the descent's harvest to coordinatize (F1's `O_p(Aut)`), so at large `d` (where the plain descent stalls)
  recognition stalls too; C4 (Aut-free coordinatization) is what makes the certified path independent of the harvest.
  No regressions (129/129 core canon + Route C + PermutationGroup; default-off preserves behaviour).
- **C4 `GeometricCoordinatizer` (Aut-free) — ENABLING STEP LANDED** (new file). Recovers the isotropic **lines**
  through `o` from **adjacency alone** (no Aut harvest) via the local invariant `|N(o)∩N(x)∩N(y)|` + largest-gap
  thresholding + union-find. Test `RouteCGeometryProbe.cs` (4/4): VO±₄(3,5) recover 10/16/26/36 lines, each of size
  `q−1`, **all genuinely collinear** (checked vs ground truth), directions **span dim 4** — the enabling property for
  coordinatization, validating `route_c_bootstrap_probe.py` in production C#. **REMAINING (scoped, not built):** the
  full coordinate assignment — scalar labelling of each line (Von Staudt cross-ratio / fundamental thm of projective
  geometry) + reading a vertex's coords off the parallel-line grid (Buekenhout–Shult; poly + citable for rank ≥ 3, i.e.
  `d ≥ 6`; `d=4` = special GQ). Until it lands, C3's wire uses F1's harvest at small `d`; this step is what makes the
  certified path harvest-free (hence d-scalable).

- **C4 — HARVEST-FREE INVARIANT + Route C ON BY DEFAULT (2026-07-04).** **Route C is now enabled by default**
  (`EnableRouteC = true`); the full suite passes **291/291, 0 breakages** (iso-stability tests stay green — Route C is
  iso-invariant; no test hardcodes a canonical matrix for a recognized odd-q affine-polar graph). **★ KEY C4 FINDING:**
  the canonical **invariant** `(q,m,ε)` — hence C3's whole *answer* (standard canonical graph + closed-form `|Aut|`) — is
  recoverable **HARVEST-FREE** from just `(n, valency, strong-regularity)` (`GeometricCoordinatizer.RecoverAffinePolarInvariant`,
  tested `RouteCGeometryProbe` 4/4 vs the coord-based classifier). So the d-scaling concern **for the answer is resolved
  without coordinatization**; `RecognizeFromResult` now computes the invariant harvest-free and uses the harvest **only
  for the safety confirmation** (does the recovered form reconstruct the graph — rules out a parameter-mate SRG). **What
  full coordinatization is still needed for:** making that *confirmation* harvest-free (distinguishing a genuine VO graph
  from a hypothetical cospectral parameter-mate).
- **★★ C4 FULL COORDINATIZATION — HARVEST-FREE for VO±₄(3), + the obstruction CHARACTERIZED (2026-07-04).** The
  parallelism/orientation wall was dissolved by a **linear** method: an isotropic line is an arithmetic progression, so
  `Σ coord(line points) = 0` (odd p) — a constraint with NO ordering/orientation. `CoordinatizeByLineSums` (+
  `RecoverAllIsotropicLines`) solves the line-sum system over `F_p` and recovers coords **from adjacency alone**.
  **KEY OBSTRUCTION, now crisp — CONE-BLINDNESS:** the solution space is `{linear functionals} ⊕ {cone-blind functions}`;
  the quadratic form `Q` itself satisfies every isotropic-line-sum (`ΣQ = 2Q(d) = 0` since `Q(d)=0`), so the graph
  determines coords only **up to adding multiples of `Q`**. Measured ambiguity `A = nullDim − d`: **`A=1` at q=3, `A=45`
  at q=5** (d=4). The linear part is isolated by a **shear search** over the ambiguity (the unique complement that
  *reconstructs* the form), feasible when `p^{d·A}` is small (`A=1 ⟹ 81` for p=3). **RESULT: VO±₄(3) is coordinatized
  HARVEST-FREE and reconstructs (0 mismatches, `RouteCGeometryProbe`), now WIRED into the confirmation
  (`ConfirmByMultiQuadricReconstruction` tries harvest-free first) ⟹ the WHOLE Route-C pipeline is harvest-free for
  VO±₄(3) = provably poly for that case, no descent/T0 dependence.** For `p≥5` the coordinatizer honestly DECLINES
  (ambiguity search infeasible) — the general case is the remaining hard core: **isolating the linear part past the
  cone-blind `Q`-ambiguity, whose dimension grows with `p`** (this IS the fundamental-theorem-of-geometry difficulty, now
  precisely located — NOT parallelism-detection, which the line-sum method sidesteps). **Honest state: C4 = harvest-free
  invariant DONE + harvest-free full coordinatization DONE for small-ambiguity (p=3, pipeline provably poly there) +
  large-ambiguity (p≥5) isolation = the precisely-characterized open core.**

- **FAMILY-DISPATCH SCAFFOLD (2026-07-04, §9.2.7).** Refactored the hardwired affine-polar pipeline into an
  **`IFormFamilyHandler` registry** (C# mirror of the Lean `FormAdapter`). `AffinePolarHandler` real; `Alternating` /
  `HalfSpin` / `Suzuki` handlers with **all interconnection live** (dispatch, generic result plumbing, and — for the
  odd-q multi-quadric families — the **`Confirm` step fully wired** via C1a `RecoverFormFamily`) and only their per-family
  math core (fingerprint / standard-graph / closed-form |Aut|; char-2 recovery for Suzuki) as documented stubs with a
  crisp completion contract. Dormant handlers decline safely (fall back to the descent). Suzuki's VSz(8) fingerprint is
  live. Regression clean (114/114 Route-C + core suite). This is the prep-for-other-families work: a future builder fills
  well-defined stubs, not a green field.

**▶ C# BUILD SUMMARY (2026-07-04): C1a, C1b, C2, C3, C4 + FAMILY-DISPATCH SCAFFOLD LANDED. Route-C + core suite green,
0 regressions.**
The runtime spine (recover form family → build the answer group → classify → canonicalize by iso-type → Aut-free line
recovery) is in place and validated end-to-end (order-check exact vs harvested |Aut| at n=81; scramble-invariant
canonicalization through the public orderer). **Two precisely-scoped remainders:** (a) **C4 full coordinatization**
(Von Staudt scalar recovery + Buekenhout–Shult grid) — unblocks d-scaling; (b) **PermutationGroup sifting** — unblocks
the order-check past n≈81. Multi-form (alternating/half-spin) + char-2 (Suzuki) recovery are the other future tracks.

**▶ PICK UP HERE (next actionable steps, in rough priority):**
0. ✅ **Multi-quadric bridges — DONE 2026-07-03** (brick-1-multi + F4-multi, generic; alternating at full
   instance-1 parity, half-spin pre-equipped). See STATUS "Multi-quadric bridges".
1. ✅ **Half-spin instance — DONE 2026-07-03** (`reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin`, axiom-clean). The 10 validated D₅
   spinor quadrics `S0..S9` are transcribed (`ScratchRouteC.lean §HalfSpin`), `spinor_hjoint` proved from `S0..S4`
   by coordinate isolation, sealed via `multiFormAdapter` + the shared engine; brick-1 `halfSpin_refines_coneScheme`
   landed; F4 generic. Full instance-1 parity. (This was the 3rd of 4 seals; Suzuki, item 2, followed.)
2. ✅ **Suzuki–Tits instance — DONE + CITATION-FREE 2026-07-04** (`reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki`, axiom-clean, **no
   citation, no `hσ`**). De-risked (5 σ-twisted forms, joint zero=cone exact), forms rederived, the `GF(q)^4↔𝔽₂^d`
   module bridge + `suzukiAdapter` landed, and — the citation discharge — `separates` PROVED by the second-derivative
   recovery identities on the enlarged base `{0,eᵢ,eⱼ,eᵢ+eⱼ}` (each coordinate = `DᵢDⱼ SF_k`, σ-terms cancel in char
   2; base 8, still O(d²) poly). Probes `route_c_suzuki_determine_probe.py` (frame injective for q=8/32; forms cut the
   cone exactly) + `route_c_suzuki_symbolic.py` (the polarization). **⟹ ALL FOUR FAMILIES SEALED** (three modulo one
   scoped citation each, Suzuki modulo none). §6 "Suzuki".
3. **★ Lean-side seam — DONE (2026-07-04).** The combine is landed at the honest level (§9.0a): the finer→coarser
   transfer reframed after a **vacuity correction** (`GroupReproduced` was a tautology; non-vacuous coarse-reaches-rigid
   is false = node-4), yielding the *genuine* non-vacuous content — group-pinning
   `schemeAutGroup_affineScheme_eq_affineG` (all 4 families, mod the named Skresanov citation `AffineSchemeTwoClosed`) +
   `routeC_polySupport` certificate (`ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.lean`), and the **cyclotomic dispatch branch**
   `reachesRigidOrCameron_seamDispatch`/`cyclotomic_sealDisj` (`ScratchSeamDispatch.lean`, the dropped 5th case). All
   axiom-clean. The one carried Lean atom across the seam is `htransport` (L1 — tractable, `forcedNode_relabel`-backed).
4. **★ NEXT — the C# runtime: see §9.2 (grounded build spec).** The canonizer still lacks all family handlers. **The
   load-bearing new piece is C1b `ClassicalGroupGenerators`** (build `AΓO(Q)` generators from the recovered form → hand
   to the existing Schreier–Sims), enabled by the group-pinning above. §9.2 names every existing method to build on, every
   new piece + its interface, the pipeline, the per-piece verification, and the Lean contracts. Order: C1a→C1b→C2→C3→C4.
   §9.0 explains why "4 seals + finite exceptions" collapses to "1 citation + 1 lemma" (Route C is threshold-free).
5. **The remaining carried scoped citations** (optional, to remove them from the spine): full Lean proofs of
   `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` (single-quadric uniqueness), `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily` (multi-quadric — alt /
   half-spin), `ConePreservingCollineationIsSemiSimilitude` (F2 semilinear seam), and `AffineSchemeTwoClosed` (the
   Skresanov rank-3 2-closure — new this session). *(Suzuki's `SuzukiFormsDetermine` is already discharged — item 2 —
   so it is no longer on this list.)* All are exact, correctly-scoped classical statements (finite-geometry /
   classical-group developments) — carried like `Theorem41Statement`/`G3`, discharged externally.
6. **The meta-poly rigor side (last):** residuals R1–R3 (§7a) — build the Aut-free geometric
   coordinatizer (also delivers F2's field recovery), name Buekenhout–Shult (R2), double-check `d=4` (R3).

**✅ DONE — the C# recovery front (abstract graph → coordinates → form → graph), confirmed against the REAL harness.**
- **F1 — additive-structure recovery** (`PermutationGroup.RegularNormalPSubgroup` + `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover`):
  `T = O_p(Aut)` (the socle) recovers the regular elementary-abelian translations `≅ (𝔽_p)^d`, and a basis coordinatizes
  the vertices. Probe `route_c_f1_probe.py` (algorithm) + `RouteCF1Probe.cs` (production, vs the real `ResidualGroup`,
  ground-truth exact).
- **A1 — form recovery** (`QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`): recovers `Q` up to scalar by ONE degree-2 kernel solve
  on the cone. Probe `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` (`vanishDim=1` all ε/d/q) + `RouteCF1Probe.cs`: the recovered `Q` +
  coords **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])=0 ⟺ x~y`, **0 mismatches**, VO^±₄(3), VO^±₄(5)).
- Both odd-q and char-2 for F1 (full `Aut` delivered); A1 is odd-q (char-2 = separate Arf track). All C# tests green,
  existing `PermutationGroup` tests unaffected.

**✅ DONE — the Lean spine (`ChainDescent/ScratchRouteC.lean`, all axiom-clean, NOT in `build.sh`).**
- `coords_determine_spanning` + `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` — the **spanning-base** generalization
  of the landed `coords_determine`/`viaOrthogonalForm`: the isometry scheme `O(Q)` discretizes at ANY base whose
  differences span (Route C individualizes an iso-invariantly chosen base, not the literal standard frame).
- `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` (**A3 brick 1**) — `O(Q)≤GO(Q)` ⟹ the isometry scheme (exact-`Q` relations)
  refines the given similitude graph (isotropy-only). The consistency half of the bridge.
- **F4 equivariance core (NEW 2026-07-03, axiom-clean):** `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` — the linear part `g` of
  a graph iso carries the `Q`-cone to the `Q'`-cone, hence (via the carried `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm`) the recovered
  **difference colouring** transports by one global scalar: `Q'(g u − g t) = μ · Q(u − t)`. Provable bricks
  `similitude_colouring_equivariant` (the equivariance identity) + `similitude_conePreserving` (cone consistency); the
  one non-elementary link is `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` (below).
- **The assembled spine:** recover `Q` (F1+A1, C# done) → work on the finer isometry scheme (refines the given graph,
  brick 1) → discretize at a spanning base (`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning`, landed) → the whole thing is iso-invariant
  (F4). **Discreteness does NOT transfer down to the similitude scheme** (that's the node-4 stall) — so Route C is a
  *distinct canonicalization object*, and F4 supplies exactly the iso-invariance that makes "discrete ⟹ canonical".

**◻ REMAINING — the classical carry, the meta claim, and the bootstrapping question.**
- **✅ `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` — DISCHARGED as an exact citation (2026-07-03).** "a nondegenerate quadric
  determines its quadratic form up to a nonzero scalar" (the `vanishDim=1` fact, = A1's Lean side = F4's one
  non-elementary link — they unify). Now a **correctly-scoped named premise** (`p ≠ 2`, `4 ≤ d`, `Q.polarBilin`
  nondegenerate) — the *exact range where it is TRUE* (the unrestricted `∀ Q R` form is FALSE at `d=3,q=3`: a conic's 4
  points lie on a pencil, `vanishDim=2`). Carried like `Theorem41Statement`/G3 (Mathlib has no quadric Nullstellensatz);
  reference = Hirschfeld, *Projective Geometries over Finite Fields* / the projective Nullstellensatz for a nondegenerate
  quadric; probe-confirmed exactly in-scope (`d=4,6,8`, `q=3,5,7,11`). A full Lean proof (finite-geometry development) is
  optional future work; the citation is exact + non-vacuous, so the carry is legitimate.
- **Meta poly claim:** "poly" stays a meta-argument over the bounded-base discreteness object + poly per-node (no runtime
  model in Lean).
- **★ ASSESSED — meta-poly bootstrapping (spotted + resolved 2026-07-03; full write-up §7a):** F1 as built recovers
  coordinates from `T = O_p(Aut)` — it **consumes `Aut`**, whose poly computation is the open T0 problem Route C sidesteps
  (potential circularity). **Verdict: resolved at the meta level — Route C is genuinely poly, non-circular.** Key points:
  (i) coordinatization is a **global** computation, not bounded-round WL, so it is NOT the node-4 wall in disguise; (ii)
  `O_p(Aut)` was only a de-risking shortcut — the poly pipeline uses **Aut-free geometric coordinatization** (recover the
  polar-space geometry from the graph, coordinates via Buekenhout–Shult, rank≥3 / `d≥6`; `d=4` = GQ special case); (iii)
  the enabling primitive is **probe-confirmed Aut-free** (`route_c_bootstrap_probe.py`: the local invariant separates
  collinear triangles and recovers spanning isotropic lines, all VO^± `d=4,6` `q=3,5`). Residuals (record, don't block):
  build the geometric coordinatizer (R1), name the geometry-recovery citation (R2), double-check `d=4` (R3). The Lean
  object (F4) is unaffected (no runtime model in Lean). See §7a.
- **◑ F2 (`q=pᵉ` Frobenius seam) — Lean core LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean):**
  `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant_semilinear` — the recovered form is iso-invariant up to scalar **and** a field
  automorphism σ (a graph iso over 𝔽_q is 𝔽_p-semilinear, `g = M∘σ̂`). `q=p` is the `σ=id` case. Remaining F2 = the C#
  field-recovery side, which folds into R1 (geometric coordinatization recovers PG over 𝔽_q, field included).
- **✅ F3 (`IFormStructure` engine interface) — LANDED + ALL 4 INSTANCES SEALED (axiom-clean):**
  `FormAdapter` + `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron` (any adapter ⟹ seal; char-2-ready, verified at `p=2`);
  **inst 1** affine-polar `affinePolarAdapter`; **inst 2** alternating `Alt(5,q)` `reachesRigidOrCameron_alternating`
  (`multiFormAdapter` + Plücker forms); **inst 3** half-spin `reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin` (`multiFormAdapter` + 10
  spinor quadrics); **inst 4** Suzuki `reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki` (σ-twisted multi-form + `GF(q)^4↔𝔽₂^d` module
  bridge, `suzukiAdapter`). Each family = one `FormAdapter`; the multi-quadric families reduce to `Qs`+`hjoint` via
  `multiFormAdapter`; Suzuki reduces to the 5 σ-forms + the bridge + `suzuki_separates`.
- **✅ §9 combine / seam — DONE at the honest level (2026-07-04):** the group-pinning (`schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG`,
  all 4 families mod the named Skresanov citation `AffineSchemeTwoClosed`) + `routeC_polySupport` certificate
  (`ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.lean`) + the cyclotomic dispatch (`ScratchSeamDispatch.lean`), all axiom-clean, after
  the **vacuity correction** (§9.0a). One carried Lean atom remains: `htransport` (L1, tractable). **Remaining:** the
  **C# runtime** (§9.2 grounded build spec; load-bearing = C1b `ClassicalGroupGenerators`) + optionally building L1
  (`htransport`) and promoting the scoped citations (`NondegQuadricDeterminesForm`, `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily`,
  `ConePreservingCollineationIsSemiSimilitude`, `AffineSchemeTwoClosed`) to full Lean proofs. **No further family builds remain.**

**Quality bar (project-wide):** every Lean theorem axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; no `sorry`,
no fresh `axiom`; `native_decide` banned; full build green when ported. "Poly time" stays a **meta-argument** (the
project formalizes no runtime model): the structural deliverables are the seal disjunction `reachesRigidOrCameron`
(banked) and the *bounded-base discreteness object* Route C constructs; "poly" is the meta-claim over that + poly
per-node.

---

## 1. The claim, and why Route C

**The claim.** The abstract forms graph determines its defining form `Q` (up to scalar) by elementary linear algebra;
its automorphism group is then the **known** affine similitude group `AΓO^ε(Q)`, whose canonicalization is standard
poly group theory (Schreier–Sims — already implemented, §4). No WL-reaches-orbits, no count crux.

**Why Route C (the wall it dodges).** The direct routes canonize by driving refinement to the orbit partition. On the
forms graph the descent runs on the **similitude SRG**, whose relations record only the **isotropy class** of a
difference (zero / nonzero-isotropic / anisotropic), *not* the exact `Q`-value. Recovering the exact bilinear values
from bounded-base isotropy counts is the **node-4 WL-dimension wall** — open both ways, and it closed the direct build
(`ColorRefinesGramK` is circular; the round-2 colouring is a character-handleless "count of counts"; the FLAG lead is
negative — recovery doc §9.8.9). Route C reads `Q` off the cone **directly** (the cone is an iso-invariant of the
graph; the degree-2 form vanishing on it is canonical up to scalar), so it never touches that wall.

**Where it sits.** Banked quasipoly seal `AffinePolarSeal.reachesRigidOrCameron_affinePolar` = the floor (correctness).
Route C = the poly-cost upgrade for the forms-graph residue. It is a **larger build + a behavioural change** (a
structure-recovery pre-processor); pursue it *because* the lighter WL route stalled, not before.

---

## 2. Knowledge foundation

### 2a. The object
- **Graph.** `V = K^d` (`K = 𝔽_q`, `q = p^e`, `d = 2m`); adjacency `Q(x − y) = 0` for a nondegenerate quadratic form
  `Q` of type `ε` — the affine-polar forms graph `VO^ε_{2m}(q)`. A translation (Cayley) scheme ⟹ vertex-transitive,
  schurian, primitive rank-3 SRG.
- **Automorphisms.** `Aut = ` translations `⋊ ΓO^ε(Q)` (affine similitudes: linear maps `g` with `Q(gx) = μ(g)·σ(Q(x))`
  for a scalar `μ` and a field automorphism `σ`; for prime `q`, just `GO^ε(Q)`, no field twist). `|Aut|` is huge (e.g.
  `VO⁻₄(3)`: `233280 = 3⁴·|GO⁻₄(3)|`) — the graph is far from rigid, which is *why* the harvest keeps branching small.
- **The two forms `make_Q` uses** (probe ground truth): `ε=+1`: `Σᵢ x_{2i}x_{2i+1}` (hyperbolic); `ε=−1`:
  `Σ x_{2i}x_{2i+1} + x_{d-2}² − g·x_{d-1}²` with `g` = least non-square (elliptic).
- **Skresanov isolation.** The seal's residue is the schurian affine slice `{1-dim cyclotomic (cited) + forms-graphs
  (c)–(f)}`; Route C's recovery is needed on (c)–(f) `{affine-polar / alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits}`.

### 2b. Why the cone determines `Q` (the algebra that dodges the wall)
The connection set from the origin is the punctured isotropic cone `C = {x ≠ 0 : Q(x) = 0}`. The homogeneous degree-2
forms vanishing on `C` form a vector space; for a nondegenerate quadric with `d ≥ 3` and non-tiny `q` that space is
**1-dimensional = ⟨Q⟩** (a classical finite-geometry fact; probe-confirmed dim `= 1` with no exceptions in range).
So `Q` is recovered by ONE linear solve over the `d(d+1)/2` degree-2 monomials — poly, non-circular (no WL, no orbits).
The cone only fixes `Q` **up to scalar `μ`**, but that is exactly right: `O(Q) = O(μQ)` and `GO(Q) = GO(μQ)`, so the
recovered object is well-defined, and in the refined colouring the global `μ` cancels in every comparison.

### 2c. The honest subtlety — isometry scheme vs. the given similitude graph
The landed `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm` (§4) seals `affineScheme (isometryGroup Q)` — the **isometry**
scheme `O(Q)`, whose relations are the **exact** `Q`-value of a difference. But the *given graph* is
`affineScheme (similitudeGroup Q)` — the **similitude** scheme `GO(Q)`, whose relations are only the isotropy class
(`∃ g∈GO(Q), g(u−t)=u'−t ⟺ isoClass(u−t)=isoClass(u'−t)`). At any bounded base the isotropy profile does **not**
jointly-separate — that is the stall. So Route C's load-bearing new content is **not** "invoke `viaOrthogonalForm`";
it is:

> **The recovered form `Q` refines the similitude graph to the isometry scheme.** Colour each pair `(t, z)` by `Q(z − t)`
> (well-defined up to the *global* scalar `μ`, which cancels in comparisons). That refined colouring is (i)
> **iso-invariant** (a graph iso carries the cone to the cone, hence `Q` to a scalar multiple), and (ii) **discretizes
> at a spanning base** via `coords_determine` / `spanning_sameExactGram_determines`.

`coords_determine` and the spanning generalization are landed; the refinement bridge + its iso-invariance are the new
lemmas (A3 / F4 in §6).

---

## 3. The architecture — 1 engine + N adapters (the merge)

The families **merge at the "recovered structure → iso-invariant refining data on `V`" boundary**. Once a family hands
the generic engine (a) the recovered form as a colouring of pairs and (b) a "form-values-at-a-base determine the vertex"
certificate, everything downstream is shared. So Route C is **one generic engine + a small `IFormStructure` interface
with 4 implementations** — *not* four separate objects, and *not* one monolith with four branches.

**Merge boundaries — what is shared vs. family-specific:**

| layer | shared (1 impl) | family-specific (N adapters) |
|---|---|---|
| additive/affine recovery (F1) | ✅ `T = O_p(Aut)` — identical for all | — |
| 𝔽_q-scalar recovery (F2) | ✅ | — |
| the generic engine (refine-by-φ, canonical base, discretize) — F3/F5 | ✅ | — |
| Schreier–Sims / `PermutationGroup.cs` | ✅ (exists) | — |
| iso-invariant base construction, direction-blind lex-min | ✅ | — |

| **`Separates`** (the `coords_determine` analog) | — | **the form's nondegeneracy** |
| **`AutGens`** (classical-group generators; only for the \|Aut\| side) | — | **the classical group** |

Affine-polar / alternating / half-spin share ~all of `RecoverForm` and `Separates` (all recover a bilinear/quadratic
form and separate by polar-nondegeneracy). **Suzuki–Tits is the one genuinely-different adapter** (non-form σ-twisted
ovoid, char-2 — same interface, different internals; folds into the char-2 track, plan §11.5).

## 5. The probes (what is already validated, and how to re-run)

All in `GraphCanonizationProofs/` (pure Python, `python3 <file>`; reuse `model_gap.py` helpers `make_Q`/`sub`/`polar`/
`isoclass`/`add`).

- **`route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` — A1 (form recovery).** For each `(ε,d,q)`, builds the isotropic cone and computes
  the rank of the degree-2 vanishing system. **Result: `vanishDim = 1` everywhere** (ε=±, d=4,6,8, q=3,5,7,11) ⟹ `Q`
  reconstructible up to scalar by one linear solve, no small-`q` exception. (Odd `q`; char-2 is a separate track — over
  `𝔽_{2^k}` squaring collapses degree, so the degree-2 vanishing space differs; handled by the Arf/char-2 substrate.)
- **`route_c_f1_probe.py` — F1 (additive-structure recovery).** Builds `VO^ε₄(q)` with true translations + monomial
  isometries, **scrambles** by a random relabelling, then recovers `O_p` via normal closures with **no ground-truth
  reference**. **Result (VO^ε₄(3), VO^ε₄(5), both types): `Op == T` exactly, regular, elementary-abelian, and the
  recovered coordinates give `coneVanishDim = 1`** ⟹ recovery is method-correct, scramble-invariant, and hands A1 a
  valid coordinatization. (Odd `q`: `−1` is a `p'`-element so `G₀` is a `p'`-group and `O_p(G)=T` is clean; char-2
  recovers `T` the same way but needs Aut's `p'`-part, e.g. `S₅` for Clebsch.)
- **`RouteCF1Probe.cs` — F1 + A1 against the REAL harness (C#, `GraphCanonizationProject.Tests/`).** Builds `VO^ε₄(q)`,
  runs the actual chain-descent canonizer, and confirms end-to-end (via the **production** methods) that (I)
  `CanonResult.ResidualGroup` contains the translations and has full `|Aut|`, (II) `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover`'s
  translation group equals `T` **exactly** (ground-truth), regular + elementary-abelian, and (III)
  `QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`'s `Q` + those coordinates **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])
  =0 ⟺ x~y`, 0 mismatches). **All pass** (q=2,3 fast, both types; q=5 `LongRunning`). Confirms the harness↔F1↔A1 chain.
- **`route_c_halfspin_probe.py` — the D₅ half-spin spinor-quadric de-risking (2026-07-03).** Generates genuine
  pure spinors via the char-free big-cell Pfaffian formula and empirically fits the degree-2 vanishing ideal, then
  validates: dim `= 10` (q=3,5,7,11), **exact 𝔽₂ zero-locus count `= 2296` = the spinor-variety target** (`1+(q−1)∏₁⁴(qⁱ+1)`),
  𝔽₃ Monte-Carlo match (z=0.10), and **joint polar radical `= 0`** (= the Lean `hjoint`, provable from the 5 quadruple
  forms). Prints the 10 explicit forms (§6). Caught that the naive moment map gave the wrong forms — the reason to
  de-risk empirically, not template. The port reference for instance 3.
- **`route_c_suzuki_probe.py` — the Suzuki–Tits (f) de-risk (2026-07-04, q=8).** Builds GF(8) + the Tits
  endomorphism `σ` + the ovoid + cone + VSz(8) (Cayley on 𝔽₂¹², adjacency = 12-bit XOR ∈ cone). Validates the object
  (`σ²=Frob`, `|O|=65`, `|cone|=455`, SRG(4096,455,6,56) — ovoid formula `c=ab+σ(a)a²+σ(b)` correct) and measures the
  `separates` base three ways: **plain-cone direct-profile > 30 (rank-3 ⟹ ≥log₂n ⟹ quasipoly)**, **iterated
  refinement = 4**, and — decisive — **joint σ-form-value profile injective at base 4 ≤ d+1 (POLY)**. Also derives the
  poly object: a **5-dim family of σ-twisted forms** whose joint zero = cone exactly ⟹ Suzuki = **multi-(σ)-form
  adapter** (σ-twisted sibling of alternating/half-spin). §6 "Suzuki".
- **`route_c_bootstrap_probe.py` — the meta-poly bootstrapping crux (§7a).** Confirms the isotropic-line geometry through
  `o` is recoverable from **adjacency alone** (no `Aut`): the local invariant `|N(o)∩N(x)∩N(y)|` **perfectly separates**
  collinear from non-collinear isotropic triangles (all VO^± `d=4,6` `q=3,5`), and the recovered lines' directions **span
  `V`**. This is the Aut-free enabling primitive that de-circularizes F1's coordinatization.
- **Supporting (from the direct route, still relevant):** `model_gap.py` (the isoClass scheme + orbit/refinement
  helpers), `factorization_probe.py`/`flag_stall_probe.py` (the node-4 stall evidence that motivates Route C).

## 6. The build plan

### Foundation (must exist before the family builds)

| # | piece | side | status / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | **Additive/affine recovery** — `T = O_p(Aut)` (the socle), a basis → coordinates, any vertex → origin | C#+Lean | **✅ CONFIRMED + PRODUCTIONIZED (2026-07-03).** Confirmed against the REAL harness (`RouteCF1Probe.cs`): recovers `T` exactly (ground-truth), regular + elementary-abelian, coordinatizes the cone (`vanishDim=1`) — VO^ε₄(q), q=2,3,5, both types; char-agnostic (full `Aut` delivered). **Production code landed:** general group ops on `PermutationGroup.cs` (`RegularNormalPSubgroup(p)`, `NormalClosure`, `Elements`, `HasExponentDividing`, `Perm.Order`/`Pow`) + `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover` (coordinatization); the probe now exercises the production path (all pass; 26 existing `PermutationGroup` tests green). "`soc = O_p = T`" = the affine-primitive **socle theorem** (cite). Remaining: the Lean side (F4 iso-invariance) + `q=pᵉ` (F2). |
| **F2** | **𝔽_q-scalar recovery** (q=pᵉ) — recover the field/Frobenius structure (the ΓL/semilinear seam) | C#+Lean | **◑ SEMILINEAR CORE LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean` §F2):** `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant_semilinear` — a graph iso over 𝔽_q is 𝔽_p-**semilinear** (`g = M∘σ̂`), so the recovered form transports up to scalar **and** field auto σ: `Q'(gu−gt)=μ·σ(Q(u−t))`. Bricks `frobVec`/`frobVec_sub`/`semisimilitude_colouring_equivariant` (provable) + cited `ConePreservingCollineationIsSemiSimilitude` (fundamental thm of proj. geometry, carried). The `q=p` case = the `σ=id` specialization. **𝔽_q-structure RECOVERY** (getting the field) is subsumed by geometric coordinatization (§7a/R1: Buekenhout–Shult recovers PG over 𝔽_q). Remaining: C# field recovery (with R1) |
| **F3** | **`IFormStructure` interface + generic engine** (refine-by-φ, canonical base, discretize) | C#+Lean | **◑ LEAN INTERFACE LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean`):** `FormAdapter` (bundles `G₀` + `−1∈G₀` + a bounded base + the `separates` certificate) + `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron` (the shared engine theorem: any adapter ⟹ the seal, family-agnostic) + `affinePolarAdapter` (instance 1, validates non-vacuity, reproduces `viaOrthogonalForm`). Each family now = **one `FormAdapter`** (supply only `separates`). C# side (thin merge point) still to build |
| **F4** | **Iso-invariance of the recovered `φ`** — the `forcedNode_relabel` analog: `RecoverForm` is relabeling-equivariant up to scalar | Lean | **✅ EQUIVARIANCE CORE LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean`):** `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` (+ bricks `similitude_colouring_equivariant`/`similitude_conePreserving`). Rests only on `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` — **discharged as an exact scoped citation** (= A1's finite-geometry uniqueness; F4 and A1-Lean unify). Not vacuous (scoped `p≠2`/`d≥4`, exactly the true range) |
| **F5** | **Generic seal→poly spine** — `RecoverForm ⟹ refined scheme ⟹ discrete_affineScheme_of_jointSeparates ⟹ viaSpielman` | Lean | **downstream all landed & generic**; only the A3 refinement bridge is new |

### Instance 1 — affine-polar `VO^ε` (proves the whole spine)

| # | piece | status |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | `RecoverForm` = solve the degree-2 vanishing system on the cone | **✅ CONFIRMED + PRODUCTIONIZED (2026-07-03, `QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`):** recovers `Q` up to scalar by one kernel solve on F1's coordinates; the recovered `Q` + coords **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])=0 ⟺ x~y`, **0 mismatches**, VO^±₄(3)). Odd-q (returns null in char-2). Lean side = a finite-geometry nondegeneracy lemma (`⟨Q⟩` = the vanishing space) |
| **A2** | `Separates` = `coords_determine` / `spanning_sameExactGram_determines` | **LANDED, axiom-clean** |
| **A2⁺** | the spanning back-half — `RouteC.coords_determine_spanning` + `RouteC.reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` (isometry scheme discretizes at any iso-invariantly-chosen spanning base) | **✅ LANDED 2026-07-03, axiom-clean** (`ScratchRouteC.lean`, NOT in `build.sh`) |
| **A3** | **the refinement bridge** — recovered `Q` upgrades the similitude graph to the isometry scheme, which `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` discretizes | **◑ brick 1 LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean`):** `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` — `O(Q)≤GO(Q)` ⟹ the isometry scheme (exact-`Q` relations) refines the given similitude graph (isotropy-only). The consistency half. Remaining A3 content = the discreteness-transfer, now discharged by **F4** (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant`, ✅ landed 2026-07-03) — the iso-invariance that makes "discrete ⟹ canonical" |
| **A4** | `AutGens` = `GO(Q)` generators (reflections) → existing `PermutationGroup` (only for the \|Aut\| side) | Schreier–Sims exists; generator list is standard classical-group data |

Instance 1 forces F1/F3/F4/F5 into existence, so it is **most of the total work**; the other three families then
reduce to writing their `IFormStructure` implementation.

### Instances 2–4 — reuse the engine, write only the adapter (plan §11.4/§11.5)
**The Lean interface `FormAdapter` (F3) is now LANDED** — each family reduces to **one `FormAdapter` instance**, i.e.
supplying its `G₀`, base, and `separates` certificate; `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron` then seals it for free.
The genuine per-family content is exactly `separates` (+ identifying `G₀`):
- **Alternating (d) — SCOPED + build STARTED (2026-07-03).** `Alt(n,q)`: vertices `Λ²(𝔽_q^n)` (alternating
  matrices), adjacency `rank(A−B)=2`. **Two regimes:**
  - **`n=4` is affine-polar in disguise:** `Λ²(𝔽_q^4)≅𝔽_q^6`, `rank<4 ⟺ Pf=0`, and the Pfaffian `Pf=A₁₂A₃₄−A₁₃A₂₄
    +A₁₄A₂₃` is a single **nondegenerate quadratic form** ⟹ `Alt(4,q)=VO⁺₆(q)`, already covered by `affinePolarAdapter`
    (`Q:=Pf`). **Not a new family.** (Buildable now: define `Pf`, prove nondeg, instantiate — deferred, low value.)
  - **`n≥5` is the genuinely-new family — MULTI-QUADRIC:** `rank≤2` is cut out by the **Plücker quadrics** (4×4
    sub-Pfaffians; 5 for `n=5`), so the connection set is their **joint cone** (Grassmann `G(2,n)`). Each Plücker form
    is individually degenerate; only *jointly* do their polar forms separate. **✅ `Alt(5,q)` FULLY SEALED
    (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean §Plucker`):** the concrete 5 sub-Pfaffians `Pf₀..Pf₄` on `𝔽_p^10`
    (built via `linMulLin`), their joint nondegeneracy `plucker_hjoint` (`Pf₀` isolates coords `4..9`, `Pf₁` isolates
    `1,2,3`, `Pf₂` isolates `0`), assembled by `multiFormAdapter` into `alternatingAdapter`, sealed by the capstone
    **`reachesRigidOrCameron_alternating`** — the first concrete **non-quadratic (multi-form)** Route-C family, end to
    end. (Honest scope: the seal is for `affineScheme(⨅ₖ O(Pf_k))`; that this scheme *is* `Alt(5,q)` is the modeling
    claim, same status as `affinePolarAdapter` modeling `VO^ε`.) The rank-3 alternating forms graph is exactly
    `Alt(4,q)` [=affine-polar] + `Alt(5,q)` [sealed], so **instance 2 (alternating) is DONE — now at full
    instance-1 parity** (all three legs: seal + brick-1-multi `alternating_refines_coneScheme` +
    F4-multi `recoveredFamily_colouring_equivariant`, the last resting on the carried `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily`).
    *Was Medium — landed.*
- **Half-spin (e) — SCOPED + reduction LANDED + ✅ SPINOR QUADRICS DE-RISKED & VALIDATED (2026-07-03).** The
  **D₅ half-spin** action: `Spin₁₀(q)` on the 16-dim half-spin module `𝔽_q^16`, rank 3. Connection set = the
  **pure-spinor cone** (spinor variety `S₅ ⊂ P^15`), cut out by **10 quadratic equations** (the D₅ vector rep = the
  Berkovits SO(10) pure-spinor constraint `λΓ^aλ=0`). Another MULTI-QUADRIC family — reuses `multiFormAdapter` +
  `coords_determine_multi` + the just-landed generic bridges (**no new engine, no new bridges**). `halfSpin_reduction`
  (axiom-clean, `§HalfSpin`) commits the dimensions and reduces to: supply the 10 spinor quadrics `Qs` + `hjoint`.
  **✅ DE-RISKING PASS DONE — the 10 equations are FOUND, EXPLICIT, and VALIDATED (`route_c_halfspin_probe.py`).**
  Method: generate genuine pure spinors by the char-free big-cell Pfaffian formula (`ω(b)_∅=1`, `ω(b)_{ij}=b_{ij}`,
  `ω(b)_{ijkl}=Pf(b|_{ijkl})`) and empirically fit the degree-2 vanishing ideal (bulletproof — the naive moment map
  `(ω∧Γ^aω)_top` gave WRONG forms, caught by the probe). **Validation (all pass):** dim of vanishing ideal `= 10`
  exactly (q=3,5,7,11); **EXACT 𝔽₂ point count of the joint zero locus `= 2296 = 1+(q−1)∏₁⁴(qⁱ+1)`** (the forms cut
  *precisely* the spinor cone, nothing bigger); 𝔽₃ Monte-Carlo count matches target (z=0.10); **joint polar radical
  `= 0` (the Lean `hjoint`)**, and it holds already from just the 5 "quadruple" forms — so `hjoint` is provable by the
  `plucker_hjoint` coordinate-isolation pattern (each `Q_a` isolates ∅, its own quadruple, and 6 pairs). **The 10
  forms, in port-ready `Fin 16` indexing** (`0:∅`; pairs `1:12 2:13 3:23 4:14 5:24 6:34 7:15 8:25 9:35 10:45`;
  quadruples `11:1234 12:1235 13:1245 14:1345 15:2345`), each a 4-term `linMulLin` sum like the Plücker `Pf`:
  - **quadruple forms** (`x_∅·x_{ijkl} = Pf`): `Q₀=-x₀x₁₁+x₁x₆-x₂x₅+x₃x₄`, `Q₁=-x₀x₁₂+x₁x₉-x₂x₈+x₃x₇`,
    `Q₂=-x₀x₁₃+x₁x₁₀-x₄x₈+x₅x₇`, `Q₃=-x₀x₁₄+x₂x₁₀-x₄x₉+x₆x₇`, `Q₄=-x₀x₁₅+x₃x₁₀-x₅x₉+x₆x₈`  ← these 5 give `hjoint`.
  - **pair×quadruple forms**: `Q₅=-x₁x₁₄+x₂x₁₃-x₄x₁₂+x₇x₁₁`, `Q₆=-x₁x₁₅+x₃x₁₃-x₅x₁₂+x₈x₁₁`,
    `Q₇=-x₂x₁₅+x₃x₁₄-x₆x₁₂+x₉x₁₁`, `Q₈=-x₄x₁₅+x₅x₁₄-x₆x₁₃+x₁₀x₁₁`, `Q₉=-x₇x₁₅+x₈x₁₄-x₉x₁₃+x₁₀x₁₂`  ← needed to model
    the graph (cone = joint zero of all 10), not for `hjoint`.
  **✅ PORTED & SEALED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean §HalfSpin`):** the 10 forms `S0..S9` transcribed
  via `linMulLin`+`LinearMap.proj`; polars `S0_polar..S4_polar`; `spinor_hjoint` proved from `S0..S4` by the
  `plucker_hjoint` coordinate-isolation pattern; assembled by `multiFormAdapter` into `spinAdapter`, sealed by
  `reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin`; brick-1 `halfSpin_refines_coneScheme` (F4 generic). **Instance 3 DONE, full
  instance-1 parity.** *Was Medium–high — de-risked then landed.*
- **Suzuki–Tits (f) — SCOPED (2026-07-03). The outlier, but much cleaner under Route C than the old pair-route
  framing.** `VSz(q)` = the Cayley graph on `GF(q)^4` (`q=2^{2e+1}`), connection set = the cone over the **Tits ovoid**
  `O={(1,a,b,ab+a^{σ+2}+b^σ)}∪{(0,0,0,1)}`, `σ` = the Tits endomorphism (`σ²=Frob`; `q=8⟹σ(x)=x⁴`); small-Aut
  (`Sz(q)⊂Aut`, `|Aut|~q⁴`), **cospectral with `VO⁻₄(q)`** (separated only by `Sz(q)`).
  - **Route-C shape: a PLAIN `FormAdapter`, NOT a `multiFormAdapter`** (there is no quadratic-form family; the ovoid
    polynomial is σ-twisted, non-quadratic). `G₀` = the ovoid-cone stabilizer linear group (`⊇ Sz(q)`), viewed over
    `𝔽₂` after restricting scalars from `GF(q)` (module `Fin d → ZMod 2`, `d=4(2e+1)`). `base` = an `O(1)` base (an
    old probe shatters at base 9 ≪ √4096). `separates` = the **only** bespoke content.
  - **★ THE BIG WIN — Route C sidesteps Suzuki's worst risk.** The old plan's Handle 2 (σ-twisted exponential-sum
    *count*, "the highest analytic risk of any family", Weil/Deligne territory — formsgraph-plan §11.4) is a
    WL-refinement/counting artefact. Route C never counts; it only needs **discreteness at a bounded base** =
    **Handle 1** (direct geometric individualization on the explicit Tits coordinates: individualize `O(1)` reference
    vertices, read off σ-twisted incidences ⟹ pin `(a,b,c)` combinatorially). So the Weil risk is OFF THE TABLE, and
    no char-2 `χ`/Gauss/Arf substrate is needed for the ENGINE (that was a pair-route requirement).
  - **✅ VERIFIED — the shared engine is char-2-ready (Lean-checked 2026-07-03).** `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron`
    elaborates and seals at `p=2`, and **`neg_mem` is FREE** in char 2 (`LinearEquiv.neg (ZMod 2)` *is* the identity,
    so it lies in any `G₀`). So the entire engine + seal wiring + F1 translation-recovery are shared/free; **`separates`
    is the sole bespoke piece.**
  - **Discharging `separates` (= the ovoid-stabilizer discretizes at a bounded base):** neither `Sz(q)` nor the Tits
    ovoid nor `σ` (`σ²=Frob` over `GF(2^{2e+1})`) is in Mathlib, so a full proof is a major standalone build.
    **Recommended = carry it as a scoped citation** `SuzukiOvoidStabilizerSeparatesAtBase` (the geometric
    individualization / `Sz(q)` 2-transitivity + short stabilizer chain), same discipline as
    `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` — but a *bigger* carry (the other families PROVE `separates`; only Suzuki cites it),
    reflecting the outlier status. Fixed-`q` `decide` is infeasible (`n=4096`, `native_decide` banned).
  - **✅ DE-RISK PROBE DONE (2026-07-04, `route_c_suzuki_probe.py`, q=8) — object validated + a design-changing
    finding.** (i) **Object EXACTLY validated:** `σ²=Frob`; `|O|=q²+1=65`; `|cone|=(q²+1)(q−1)=455`; VSz(8) =
    **SRG(4096,455,6,56)** — the ovoid formula `c = a·b + σ(a)·a² + σ(b)` is correct (the connection set the Lean
    adapter models). (ii) **★ Poly-vs-quasipoly finding:** VSz is a **rank-3 SRG** (1-WL stable at 1 colour;
    per-base-point relation is only 2-valued). So Route C's **direct** orbit-profile `separates`
    (`discrete_affineScheme_of_jointSeparates`) on the **plain cone scheme** needs a base `≥ log₂n = 12` (probe: greedy
    `> 30`, never injective) ⟹ **only QUASIPOLY = no improvement over the banked floor.** Iterated
    individualization+1-WL discretizes at base **4** (the `Sz(q)` 2-transitivity mechanism), but that is *not* the
    direct-profile the engine uses.
  - **✅ POLY PATH CONFIRMED (2026-07-04 follow-up) — Suzuki is a MULTI-(σ)-FORM adapter, the σ-twisted sibling of
    alternating/half-spin.** No *single* σ-twisted form cuts the cone (the derived `F = x₃x₀^{σ+1}+x₁x₂x₀^σ+x₁^{σ+2}+
    x₂^σx₀²` over-vanishes: `|{F=0}|=512≠456`; the Tits ovoid isn't that hypersurface). **BUT** a **5-dim family
    `{F_k}` of σ-twisted type-(1,2) forms** (`σ(xₐ)·x_b·x_c`) has **joint zero locus = cone EXACTLY (456)** — probe
    `route_c_suzuki_probe.py`. And the **joint `F_k`-value profile separates at base 4 ≤ d+1** (injective over all 4096
    at the frame) ⟹ **POLY**, exactly the `coords_determine_multi` mechanism. (Plain cone scheme stays quasipoly.) The
    5 forms have **all-unit coefficients** (`F₀` = the derived `F`; `F₁..F₄` trim the spurious zeros) — clean,
    representation-independent support, ready to transcribe.
  - **⟹ Lean design (the σ-twisted analog of the multi-quadric adapter):** `σ` (a Frobenius power over `GF(q)`) + the
    5 σ-twisted forms `F_k` + a **σ-twisted `coords_determine_multi`** (`separates` via the joint `F_k`-value profile —
    the genuine bespoke content; prove or carry scoped) + `G₀ = ⨅ₖ {g : F_k∘g = F_k}`. **NOT the quadratic
    `multiFormAdapter`** (the `F_k` are σ-twisted, not quadratic — over the `𝔽₂` linearization they are cubic), so it
    needs a σ-twisted *sibling* of `coords_determine_multi`; but the generic `FormAdapter` engine + `neg_mem` + seal are
    shared/free (char-2-ready, verified). Then `suzukiAdapter` → `reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki`.
  - **✅ REDERIVATION LANDED (2026-07-04, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean §Suzuki`):** over an abstract char-2
    `CommRing K` with a Tits endomorphism `σ` (`σ∘σ = (·)²`), the 5 σ-twisted forms `SF0..SF4` + the `ovoidC`
    parametrization are defined, and each is **proven to cut the cone**: `suzukiForms_ovoid` (vanish on the affine
    ovoid `(1,a,b,ovoidC a b)` — via `σ` a ring hom + `σ∘σ=(·)²`, char-2 cancellation), `suzukiForms_infty` (vanish
    at `(0,0,0,1)`), `suzukiForms_homog` (σ-twisted homogeneous `SF_k(λx)=σλ·λ²·SF_k(x)`, so `{SF_k=0}` is a cone).
    `SF0` = the single derived form; `SF1..SF4` trim its spurious zeros. Representation-independent (all-unit coeffs).
  - **✅✅ `separates` PROVED CITATION-FREE (2026-07-04, axiom-clean, `§Suzuki`) — the citation discharge.** The
    earlier draft carried `separates` via the scoped citation `SuzukiFormsDetermine` (the first-order frame `{0,eⱼ}`
    value-profile determines the vertex — true for `GF(2^{2e+1})`, verified injective for q=8/32 by
    `route_c_suzuki_determine_probe.py`, but its only known proof needs `Sz(q)` 2-transitivity: first-order data ⟹
    nonlinear, large-`q`-only recovery). **The discharge:** enlarge the base to include **pairwise sums**
    `{0, eᵢ, eⱼ, eᵢ+eⱼ}` — then each coordinate is a **second discrete derivative** of one σ-form,
    `DᵢDⱼ SF_k(v) := SF_k(v)+SF_k(v−eᵢ)+SF_k(v−eⱼ)+SF_k(v−eᵢ−eⱼ)`, and in char 2 the σ-terms and constants **cancel**,
    collapsing it to a bare coordinate: `x₂=D₀D₁ SF0`, `x₃=D₀D₁ SF1`, `x₀=D₁D₃ SF1`, `x₁=D₂D₃ SF4` (verified by hand
    + over GF(8) all-4096 + GF(32); found via `route_c_suzuki_symbolic.py`). So `separates` is **elementary char-2
    algebra**, valid over ANY `CharP K 2` ring — no citation, no `hσ`, no field-size hypothesis. Decls: the scalar
    identities `SF0_recover`/`SF1_recover_x3`/`SF1_recover_x0`/`SF4_recover_x1` (`simp`+`ring_nf`+char-2 close), their
    `SFv`-lifts `recover_x0..x3`, and the PROVED determiner `suzukiForms_determine` (funext over `Fin 4`, one recovery
    per coordinate). Base grows `4+1 → 8` (`suzukiBaseVecs`, still `O(d²)` poly). `SuzukiFormsDetermine` and the old
    `suzuki_separates` are **removed**.
  - **✅ MODULE BRIDGE + SEAL LANDED (2026-07-04, axiom-clean, `§Suzuki`):** the `GF(q)^4 ↔ 𝔽₂^d` bridge via an
    **additive** iso `Ψ : (Fin D → ZMod 2) ≃+ (Fin 4 → K)` (no `ZMod 2`-module on `K` needed — `PreservesForms` is a
    function condition; `Ψ` additive suffices for difference-transport). `SFbar` (forms in 𝔽₂-coords), `suzukiG₀`
    (clean joint-isometry subgroup), `neg_mem_suzukiG₀` (free in char 2), `suzukiBase` (`suzukiBaseVecs` images, `≤8`),
    `base_sfv_eq` (per-base-vector transport), `suzukiAdapter` (`FormAdapter (p:=2)(d:=D) 8`, `separates` = the engine
    orbit-profile transported to `suzukiForms_determine`), and the capstone **`reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki`**. Seals
    via the shared engine.
  *Single family, no Weil, no char-2 χ-substrate, no engine work. **Instance 4 SEALED end-to-end, CITATION-FREE**
  (no `SuzukiFormsDetermine`, no `hσ`); a multi-σ-form adapter with an O(d²) poly base — the σ-twisted sibling of
  alternating/half-spin.*

### C# / Lean split, and the reuse to exploit
- **The C# engine is the symmetric mirror of Option 2's Layer D** (IR doc §11.10, built through D-M4 as a Phase-2
  pre-processor: recover structure → refine/solve → plug the existing seam). **Clone that architecture**, swapping
  `IFormStructure` for the F₂ extractor. This is the payoff of the recovery↔co-recovery duality
  ([[project_recovery_corecovery_duality_2026-07-03]]): the two pre-processors share a skeleton.
- **Lean deliverable is the poly-supporting structural object**, not a runtime proof: "the recovered-form-refined
  scheme discretizes at an iso-invariantly-constructible `O(d)` base" (F5 + A3), with "poly" the meta-claim over that
  bounded base + the existing Schreier–Sims meta-cost (same discipline as Part A's `Order = ∏ orbit sizes`).

### Sequencing & risks (updated 2026-07-03)
1. ✅ **F1 + A1** (C# recovery front) — DONE + confirmed against the real harness (`AffineStructureRecovery`,
   `QuadraticFormRecovery`, `RouteCF1Probe.cs`).
2. ✅ **A2⁺ + A3 brick 1** (Lean spine from landed pieces) — DONE, axiom-clean (`ScratchRouteC.lean`).
3. ✅ **F4** equivariance core — **LANDED 2026-07-03, axiom-clean** (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` + bricks).
   Rests only on `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` — now DISCHARGED as an exact scoped citation (§ STATUS remaining).
4. ✅ **Meta-poly bootstrapping** — ASSESSED + RESOLVED (§7a): Route C is poly, non-circular (global coordinatization ≠
   bounded WL; Aut-free geometric recovery, probe-confirmed enabling primitive). Residuals R1–R3 deferred to the rigorous
   C#→Lean runtime stage (build the geometric coordinatizer; name Buekenhout–Shult; double-check `d=4`).
5. ◑ **F2** (`q=pᵉ` semilinear seam) — **Lean core LANDED** (`…_semilinear`, axiom-clean): the recovered form is
   iso-invariant up to scalar **and** Frobenius σ. Remaining: the C# field-recovery side (folds into R1's geometric
   coordinatizer — Buekenhout–Shult recovers PG over 𝔽_q, field included).
6. ✅ **Instances 1→2→3→4 — ALL SEALED axiom-clean (2026-07-03/04).** inst 1 affine-polar (`affinePolarAdapter`),
   inst 2 alternating `Alt(5,q)` (`reachesRigidOrCameron_alternating`), inst 3 half-spin (`reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin`),
   inst 4 Suzuki (`reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki`). Plus the generic multi-quadric bridges (brick-1 + F4) → alternating
   and half-spin at full instance-1 parity. **No further family builds remain.**
7. **▶ NEXT — the §9 post-four-seals combine** (four seals → one correctness object; start with the L1 iso-invariance
   de-risk, §9.1) + the C# runtime handlers (C1–C4, §9.2) + optional citation-discharge.

**Definition of done (Route C, affine-polar):** F1 recovers coordinates iso-invariantly (F4 ✅ equivariance core); A1
recovers `Q` (C# ✅; Lean uniqueness = the carried `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm`); A3 refines to the isometry scheme (brick 1
✅); `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` discretizes at the `O(d)` base and seals via `viaSpielman` (✅) — the structural
bounded-base discreteness object complete, "poly" the meta-claim over it **modulo the bootstrapping question**. The C#
engine reproduces `|Aut|` via `PermutationGroup`. **The Lean spine is now assembled;** the open items are the classical
carry + the meta-poly bootstrapping.

### 6a. F4 — iso-invariance of the recovered form (✅ LANDED 2026-07-03; kept as the design record)

**What F4 is.** The recovered `Q` (and hence F1's coordinates and the isometry-scheme colouring) must be a *canonical
function of the graph*: a graph isomorphism `σ` must carry the recovered structure of `G` to the recovered structure of
`σ(G)` (up to the scalar ambiguity of `Q`). Concretely, the connection set (cone) is carried to the connection set, so
the degree-2 form vanishing on it is carried to a scalar multiple — the recovered-`Q` difference colouring is
relabeling-**equivariant**. This is what makes "canonicalize via the recovered form" produce a *canonical* labelling
(the same up to iso), i.e. it is the iso-invariance the poly canonicalization claim needs.

**Why it's the last load-bearing piece.** The spine (recover → isometry scheme → discretize) is assembled: brick 1 says
the isometry scheme refines the given graph; `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` says it discretizes. What is *not* yet Lean-
certified is that the isometry scheme used is derived *iso-invariantly* from the given graph — without which "discrete"
does not give "canonical". F4 supplies exactly that. (Discreteness does not transfer down to the similitude scheme — the
node-4 stall — so F4 is genuinely needed; it is not implied by the banked seal.)

**The template to mirror (landed).** The symmetry-phase iso-invariant-node machinery in `Cascade.lean`:
`forcedNode` (`:2752`), `forcedNode_image` (`:2830`, image under an automorphism), `movedSet_relabel` (`:3004`),
`forcedNode_relabel` (`:3024`, equivariance under an arbitrary relabelling). F4 is the *form-recovery* analog:
`recoveredForm(σ • G) = σ • recoveredForm(G)` (up to scalar). State it against the abstract-graph relabelling the same
way `forcedNode_relabel` does.

**Risk — the vacuity trap (cf. `SchemeReproduced`, memory `project_...`).** Make the equivariant predicate strong enough
to be *useful* (it must actually pin the colouring iso-invariantly) yet true (holds for the real recovery). Check
non-vacuity against the C# ground truth (`RouteCF1Probe.cs` already exhibits the recovered `Q` reconstructing the graph —
the semantic content F4 formalizes).

**How it composes (the end state).** F4 (equivariant recovery) + brick 1 (isometry refines the graph) +
`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` (isometry discretizes at a spanning base) ⟹ the graph has an iso-invariant discrete
colouring at an `O(d)` base ⟹ (meta) poly canonical labelling. That is the Route-C deliverable for affine-polar.

---

## 7. Honest scope — what Route C does and does NOT do
- **Does:** upgrade the **forms-graph** residue from the banked quasipoly seal to **polynomial**, family by family,
  via a shared engine. Sidesteps the node-4 WL wall entirely (recovery is linear algebra, not WL).
- **Does NOT:** touch the **rigid mirror** (the IR-solver **row 4** / multipede / non-schurian residue). There is no
  large classical group to recover there — Route C is structurally inapplicable. That residue is Option 2's job
  (F₂-structure recovery, IR doc §11). **But the meta-strategy is identical** — "recover the algebraic substrate, use
  exact algebra instead of WL" — so the two pre-processors share the Layer-D architecture (§6).
- **Char-2 / Suzuki:** a separate analytic track (Arf/additive-trace, no `χ`); the *combinatorial* engine (F1/F3/F5)
  transfers char-agnostically, only `RecoverForm`/`Separates` change.
- **Dead ends (do not re-walk):** the WL/`bᵢ=1` build via `ColorRefinesGramK` (circular, node-4 wall, recovery doc
  §9.8.9); the frame-locked similitude predicates (idx 1221-1226, §4). δ′ dominator-closure is walled for `bᵢ=1`
  (dimensional wall, `ScratchDominatorForms`).

## 7a. The meta-poly bootstrapping — assessment & resolution (2026-07-03)

**The concern.** Route C's poly claim runs: recover coordinates (F1) → recover `Q` (A1, one linear solve) → `Aut = AΓO(Q)`
known → canonicalize. A1 and canonicalization are clearly poly *given coordinates*. But **F1 as built/documented
recovers coordinates from `T = O_p(Aut)` — it consumes `Aut`** (`AffineStructureRecovery.Recover(PermutationGroup aut,…)`;
the socle theorem gives `O_p(Aut)=T` *given* `Aut`, not `Aut` itself). Poly-time computation of `Aut` for this SRG
residue is *itself* the open T0 problem Route C advertises it sidesteps (recovery §7 "does not depend on the open core").
So the meta-poly *first step* is potentially circular. This must be resolved before the cost analysis, not after.

**Resolution — three findings, verdict: sound (not circular, not the node-4 wall in disguise).**

1. **Global computation ≠ bounded-round WL — the distinction that keeps Route C alive.** The node-4 wall is specifically
   that *bounded-round WL refinement* stalls (cannot recover `gramK` at a bounded base — recovery §9.8.9). Coordinatization
   is a **global** computation (all `n` vertices, linear algebra / geometry recovery), a strictly stronger model in which
   poly is reachable even when bounded-WL-dimension is unbounded (this is the whole individualization-beats-WL premise).
   So recovering coordinates is **not** the node-4 wall re-encountered — provided a concrete *global, Aut-free* procedure
   exists. It does (finding 2).

2. **`T = O_p(Aut)` was only a de-risking shortcut; the poly pipeline uses Aut-free GEOMETRIC coordinatization.** The graph
   is the collinearity graph of the affine polar space. Recover the classical geometry (isotropic points/lines) from the
   graph and read off coordinates by the **fundamental theorem of projective geometry / Buekenhout–Shult** (a polar space
   of rank ≥ 3 is classical ⟹ embeds in `PG(d,q)` ⟹ coordinates up to `PΓO`), then lift to affine — poly and **needing no
   `Aut`**. The `O_p(Aut)` route was a valid *shortcut for the de-risking probes* (which had `Aut` from the harness), not
   the poly argument. Rank ≥ 3 means **`d ≥ 6`; `d = 4` (Witt index 2) is the generalized-quadrangle special case** (outside
   Buekenhout–Shult's rank≥3 hypothesis — flagged for the rigorous stage, but the enabling primitive holds there too,
   finding 3).

3. **The enabling primitive is confirmed Aut-free — probe `route_c_bootstrap_probe.py` (2026-07-03).** The local graph
   invariant `|N(o) ∩ N(x) ∩ N(y)|` (common cone-neighbours of an isotropic triangle) **perfectly separates collinear from
   non-collinear** triangles — a clean gap in *every* case (VO^±, `d=4,6`, `q=3,5`: e.g. VO⁺₄(5) collinear=42 vs non=22;
   VO⁻₆(3) 60 vs 6). Reconstructing the isotropic lines through `o` from that invariant alone (no `Aut`, no ground truth)
   recovers exactly the punctured lines (`q−1` points each), and **their directions span `V`** uniformly. So the geometry
   is poly-recoverable from adjacency — the step that turns "recover coordinates" from circular into a standard geometry
   problem. (`d = 4` included: the primitive separates and spans there too, evidence the GQ case also goes through.)

**Verdict.** The bootstrapping is **resolved at the meta level: Route C is genuinely poly, non-circular.** The poly first
step is *geometric coordinatization* (global, Aut-free, probe-confirmed enabling primitive + Buekenhout–Shult for the
coordinate read-off), **not** `O_p(Aut)`. Route C sidesteps the *WL-refinement* crux and does **not** inherit it in
disguise (global ≠ bounded-WL).

**Residuals for the later rigorous (C#→Lean runtime) stage — record, don't block:**
- **(R1) Build the Aut-free geometric coordinatizer** to replace/supplement `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover`'s
  `O_p(Aut)` path (which is fine for de-risking but is the circular step for the poly claim). The enabling primitive
  (line recovery) is confirmed; the remaining engineering is line-geometry → frame → coordinates (the group-law/embedding).
- **(R2) Name + verify the geometry-recovery citation** (Buekenhout–Shult / recovering a polar space from its point graph)
  and its poly bound — the citation the poly claim now rests on (analogous to how the seal rests on G3).
- **(R3) Double-check `d = 4` (GQ, rank 2)** — outside the rank≥3 embedding theorem; the probe supports it, but the
  coordinate read-off needs its own (standard) argument for generalized quadrangles.

## 9. After the four seals — the combined correctness object + the C# runtime (FORWARD PLAN, build later)

**Status: THIS SECTION IS NOW LIVE (2026-07-04).** All four per-family adapters are sealed (affine-polar ✅,
alternating ✅, half-spin ✅, Suzuki ✅ — each modulo its scoped citation). Each gives
`reachesRigidOrCameron (affineScheme A.G₀)` for a *concrete* group `A.G₀` built from recovered forms. This section
is the **immediate next work**: how those four combine into ONE correctness object (§9.1), and how the C# canonizer
gets the family handlers it currently lacks (§9.2). **The recommended entry point for the next session** — start
with the L1 de-risk (§9.1: spot-check whether the four seal disjuncts are already iso-invariant), which is cheap and
validates the whole combine plan.

### 9.0 The key structural fact that keeps it clean (read first)

Route C's `FormAdapter.reachesRigidOrCameron` is **threshold-free**: it is `viaSpielman ∘
discrete_affineScheme_of_jointSeparates`, needing only *nondegeneracy* + *a bounded base* — **no `q ≥ 256` /
`q ≳ 32d` floor** (those were the pair-route/quasipoly seal's Gauss-sum thresholds, which Route C does not touch),
and the `hjoint` lemmas (`plucker_hjoint`, `spinor_hjoint`) are proved for **all primes `p`** (coordinate
isolation, ±1 coeffs, no division — not even `p≠2`). Consequence: **the small-`q`/small-`d`/sporadic cases do NOT
pile up as Route-C exceptions.** Route C only ever engages the *unbounded-WL-dimension* residue (the infinite
families); any finite/sporadic small graph has bounded `|V|` ⟹ bounded base ⟹ it is already sealed by the
*generic* bounded-base machinery (`viaSpielman` on a trivial base) and never reaches the forms-graph residue. So
the combined object carries **no finite exception pile** — the only systematic split is **char 2** (→ the
Suzuki / Arf branch, one branch, not scattered exceptions). This is why "4 seals + finitely many exceptions"
collapses to "1 classification citation + 1 iso-invariance lemma".

### 9.0a ★ CORRECTION (2026-07-04) — the combine target is the FINER→COARSER transfer, not disjunct-transport

**A scheme-level mismatch invalidates the naïve §9.1 dispatch below; read this first.** The four adapters seal the
**fine** scheme `affineScheme(isometryGroup Q)` / `affineScheme(⨅ₖ O(Q_k))` / `suzukiG₀` — the *exact*-value
scheme. The canonizer's residue `X` is the **coarse** given graph `affineScheme(similitudeGroup Q)` /
`affineScheme(jointConeStab)` — the *isotropy-only* rank-3 SRG. These are **different schemes (different rank)**, so:
- there is **no realizing permutation** `X ≅ affineScheme(G₀)` (§9.1's "transport along hiso" has a type error — the
  ScratchSeam-style transport applies only between a residue and *the same* scheme it is iso to);
- `SchemeRecoveredByDepth(fine) → SchemeRecoveredByDepth(coarse)` is **FALSE at bounded/poly base** — the coarse
  scheme's own 1-WL does not discretize there (the node-4 stall Route C sidesteps). Both `SchemeRecovered`/
  `SchemeRecoveredByDepth` are hardwired to `warmRefine (schemeAdj X)`, so they are the **wrong target** for `X`.

**User decision (2026-07-04): pursue the finer→coarser recovered-form TRANSFER** — the only route that yields
*polynomial* (not another quasipoly) closure of node 4, which is the seal's purpose (Spielman already banks quasipoly;
another quasipoly build adds nothing). **Mechanism:** the recovered `Q` is a *global*, iso-invariant (F4) poly
function of the graph — refining the coarse graph by the recovered-`Q` colouring is **free** (no branching; canonical
up to one global scalar `μ`). A *similitude* (`μ≠1`) permutes the value-classes rather than fixing them, so
`Aut(fine)=AO(Q)` is strictly smaller than `Aut(coarse)=AΓO(Q)` — refining by exact values *loses* the scalings; the
descent recovers them via a **single reference-pin orbit-branch** (individualize one anisotropic pair to pin `μ`; the
choices form one Aut(coarse)-orbit ⟹ a true symmetry ⟹ free, and its covering automorphisms ARE the scalings).

**★ VACUITY CORRECTION (2026-07-04) — there is NO non-vacuous "coarse reaches rigid" predicate to prove.** A first
build attempt targeted `GroupReproduced Sc := ∃ gens, closure gens = SchemeAutGroup Sc`. **That is VACUOUS**
(`⟨↑(SchemeAutGroup Sc), Subgroup.closure_eq _⟩` proves it for every scheme — exactly the retired `SchemeReproduced`
the project excised, `Cascade.lean` "do not regress (2026-06-07)"). The genuine, non-vacuous "reaches rigid" is
`SchemeRecoveredByDepth` — keyed on the **visible-realizer harvest over `warmRefine (schemeAdj Sc)`**, non-vacuous
precisely because its same-cell clause fails when cells ⊋ orbits. **Decisive consequence:** `SchemeRecoveredByDepth Sc`
is about the *coarse* `warmRefine`, whose cells ⊋ orbits at bounded/poly base — that IS the node-4 stall. So the
*non-vacuous* "coarse reaches rigid" is **false** here, and the only *true* form is the *vacuous* tautology.
**Route C cannot produce a non-vacuous coarse `SchemeRecoveredByDepth`; there is no finer→coarser transfer at that
level.** Instead Route C **changes the canonization object**: it augments the descent with the poly, iso-invariant
recovered form `Q` (F4) — i.e. runs on the **fine** scheme, whose `SchemeRecoveredByDepth` *is* non-vacuously true
(the adapter) — and the coarse graph is canonized because that colouring is an iso-invariant poly refinement of it
(brick-1 + F4), adding no branching. "Poly" stays the project's meta-claim over that augmented descent.

**✅ WHAT T1 ACTUALLY PROVES (2026-07-04, all axiom-clean + genuinely non-vacuous,
[`ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.lean`](../GraphCanonizationProofs/ChainDescent/ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.lean)):**
- `affineG_le_schemeAutGroup` — `affineG G₀ ≤ SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme G₀)` (the affine group acts as scheme auts
  of its own orbital scheme; via `orbMk_smul` + `isSchemeAut_of_relOfPair_eq`). The `≥` half of every 2-closure here.
- `schemeAutGroup_affineScheme_mono` (`hmono`) — `H ≤ G ⟹ SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme H) ≤ SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme G)`
  (finer affine scheme ⟹ smaller Aut group), via `affineScheme_refines_of_le` + the `relOfPair`-characterisation of
  `IsSchemeAut`. Instantiated `isometrySimilitude_schemeAutGroup_mono` (the honest "recovered form only *refines*").
- `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG` — **modulo the Skresanov 2-closure citation `hSkresanov`** (`SchemeAutGroup(coarse)
  ≤ affineG(similitude)` = no unexpected automorphisms = Skresanov rank-3 2-closure, already in the seal's stack), the
  coarse scheme's Aut group is *exactly* `affineG(similitudeGroup Q) = translations ⋊ AΓO(Q)`. The non-vacuous
  group-pinning the |Aut| side + the meta poly argument consume (and where the reference-pin scalings `AΓO ⊋ AO` live).

**Honest scope of the poly closure.** "The coarse forms graph is poly-canonized" is the **meta-composition** of: the
**fine** adapter (`SchemeRecoveredByDepth fine`, genuine harvest content) + the F4/brick-1/`hmono` canonicity bridge +
`schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG` (mod Skresanov). It is **not** a further non-vacuous Lean predicate — any predicate
on the coarse `warmRefine` is vacuous or false. This is consistent with the project's stance that "poly" is a
meta-claim over a structural object, never a Lean runtime proof.

**✅ T1-cite + certificate LANDED (2026-07-04, axiom-clean).** The Skresanov 2-closure is now a **single named
generic citation** `AffineSchemeTwoClosed hneg := SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme G₀) ≤ affineG G₀` (carried like
`Theorem41Statement`/G3), and `schemeAutGroup_affineScheme_eq_affineG` pins `SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme G₀) = affineG
G₀` for **any** `G₀` modulo it — **one lemma, all four families** (instantiate `G₀ := similitudeGroup Q` /
`jointConeStab Qs` / Suzuki cone-stab; affine-polar instance = `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG`). The honest
deliverable is bundled in **`routeC_polySupport`**: given the citation + the fine adapter's `SchemeRecoveredByDepth
fine`, it returns the triple `(i)` coarse Aut `= affineG(similitude)` `∧` `(ii)` fine harvest (genuine) `∧` `(iii)`
fine `≤` coarse (only refines) — the full structural support for the meta poly-canonization (+ F4 for iso-invariance).

**✅ T4 (cyclotomic dispatch) LANDED (2026-07-04, axiom-clean,
[`ScratchSeamDispatch.lean`](../GraphCanonizationProofs/ChainDescent/ScratchSeamDispatch.lean)).** The four-case
sketch dropped the **cyclotomic** branch (the affine residue is `{1-dim cyclotomic} ∪ {forms-graphs (c)–(f)}` — 5
cases). Fixed by generalizing the ScratchSeam dispatch: `reachesRigidOrCameron_seamDispatch` routes `S` that is
"Cameron, **or realized by *some* already-sealed scheme `Y`** (`SchemeRealizes f S Y ∧ SealDisj Y`)". Because the
cyclotomic seal `reachesRigidOrCameron_affineSlice` and every forms-graph seal conclude the **same `SealDisj` shape**,
both are instances of the single "sealed realized `Y`" disjunct — one theorem dispatches all of them. `cyclotomic_sealDisj`
supplies the cyclotomic `Y` (via `affineSlice`, mod its cited `TwinsAreSemilinear`/`PrimitiveCCClassification`);
`reachesRigidOrCameron_affineResidue` is the named combined seam. Carries the `htransport` (= L1) obligation, exactly
as ScratchSeam. **⟹ the cyclotomic branch is now first-class, and the dispatch is uniform over the whole affine residue.**

**Remaining follow-ups:** (T3) the multi-form instantiation is **already covered** by the generic pinning lemma (plug in
`jointConeStab Qs`); a concrete instance can wait for the ScratchRouteC port; (T2) the C# |Aut| runtime uses
`schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG` to hand `AΓO(Q)` to Schreier–Sims. The classification premise §9.1/L3 is unchanged
and sound (Cameron + Liebeck 1987 + Skresanov 2020/22 + Ponomarenko). `AffineSchemeTwoClosed` (= Skresanov rank-3
2-closure) is registered in `chain-descent-citation-discharge.md`. The one carried Lean obligation across the seam is
still `htransport` (L1 — the `SealDisj`-transport along a realizing permutation; scoped positive, `ScratchSeam` /
§9.0a).

> **▶ §9.1 below is SUPERSEDED for the multi-form families by §9.0a** (its "transport the adapter seal along hiso"
> mis-types the fine/coarse schemes). It stays correct for affine-polar's *quasipoly* pair-route seal (ScratchSeam),
> which is a different, already-banked object. The live combine is §9.0a's finer→coarser transfer.

### 9.1 The Lean correctness object — one dispatch theorem over one cited premise

Target shape (the clean "reaches rigid or Cameron via Route C"):
```
theorem reachesRigidOrCameron_formsGraphResidue
    (hclass : FormsGraphResidueClassification)      -- the ONE cited premise that combines the 4
    (X) (hX : «X = the unbounded-WL rank-3 primitive schurian affine residue») :
    reachesRigidOrCameron X := by
  rcases hclass X hX with ⟨Q, hiso⟩ | ⟨Qs, hiso⟩ | ⟨Qs, hiso⟩ | ⟨ov, hiso⟩   -- affine-polar / alt / half-spin / Suzuki
  -- each case: transport the matching adapter's concrete seal along hiso
```
Beyond the four adapters this needs exactly two things:

- **(L1) Scheme-level iso-invariance of `reachesRigidOrCameron`** — `X ≅ Y → (reachesRigidOrCameron X ↔
  reachesRigidOrCameron Y)`, so each adapter's *concrete* `affineScheme(G₀)` seal transports onto the abstract
  `X`. **This is the one genuinely load-bearing NEW lemma.** Requires each disjunct (`SchemeBlockRecovered`,
  `AbelianConsumed`, `SchemeRecoveredByDepth`, `IsCameronScheme`) to be iso-invariant. *NB: distinct from F4 —
  F4 is iso-invariance of the recovered form (for the runtime canonicalization); L1 is iso-invariance of the
  seal predicate (for the correctness statement). Both needed, different halves.* **De-risk first:** spot-check
  whether the four disjuncts are already iso-invariant before committing (cheap, and it validates the whole plan).
- **(L2) The dispatch theorem** above, gated on **(L3) `FormsGraphResidueClassification`** = the cited premise
  (Skresanov's rank-3 2-closure classification: the unbounded-WL rank-3 primitive schurian affine residue is
  *exactly* affine-polar / alternating / half-spin / Suzuki, and it *hands over the concrete structure*
  `Q`/`Qs`/ovoid so the adapter can be built). Carried like `Theorem41Statement`/`G3` — **one named premise, not
  a finite pile**. This premise IS the "combination".
- **(L4) Wire into the existing residue seam** `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaAffineFormScheme` (idx 1207, the node-4
  hook), retiring its quasipoly `hFormCert` in favour of this poly seal.

Sizing: L1 medium (the real work), L2 small once L1 exists, L3 a citation/scoping task, L4 small–medium.

### 9.2 The C# runtime — build spec (grounded handoff for the next builder)

> **Read this before starting the C# build.** It names every existing piece to build on (exact file/method), every
> new piece to write (with its interface + dependencies), the pipeline, the Lean contract each piece must satisfy,

#### 9.2.0 The goal + the key reframe (what this session's Lean work changed)

**Goal:** for a residue the canonizer flags as a forms-graph family, recover the defining form, compute `|Aut|` and a
canonical labelling in poly time, and return them through the existing harness — instead of the (stalled) WL descent.

**★ HONEST VALUE PROPOSITION (2026-07-04, grounded against `RouteCF1Probe.cs`) — read before building.** The existing
harness (`ChainDescent` + `CascadeOracle`, deferral on) **already canonizes the probed forms graphs with no flag and
full `|Aut|` recovered**: `RouteCF1Probe.cs` asserts `res.Flagged == false` on VO±₄(3) and VO±₄(5) via the generic
cross-branch harvest. So at small `d`, **nothing is broken**, and the acceptance bar is NOT "no longer flags" (already
true). Route C's C# payoff is the **two things the generic harvest does not give**:
1. **A provably-poly, *certified* path** — orbits read off a *known, reconstructed* classical group `AΓO(Q)`, not
   harvested empirically. This is the runtime image of the Lean seal (correctness by construction, not "the harvest
   happened to complete").
2. **`d`-scalability** — the generic harvest's cost has an open `d`-factor (2026-06-28 finding: poly-vs-superpoly in `d`
   unresolved, infeasible to run at `d=8`); building the group from the recovered form is `poly(d,q)` by construction.
So the test strategy (§9.2.4) targets **"the built group equals the recovered classical group, and the labelling is
iso-invariant"**, NOT "flags → no-flag".

**The reframe that drives the design (this session):** the Lean group-pinning `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG`
(`ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.lean`, mod the Skresanov citation `AffineSchemeTwoClosed`) proves the answer group is
**exactly `affineG(similitudeGroup Q) = translations ⋊ AΓO(Q)`** — a *known* classical group. So the C# runtime does
**not** need to *harvest* `Aut` from the descent on the coarse graph (that's the node-4 stall). It **recovers `Q`,
constructs a generating set for `AΓO(Q)` directly, and hands it to the existing Schreier–Sims** (`PermutationGroup`),
which returns `|Aut|` and the base/labelling. Correctness is then *verified by reconstruction* (the generated group
stabilises the graph; `Q`+coords reproduce adjacency — `RouteCF1Probe.cs` already does the reconstruction half).
This is why the new load-bearing C# piece below is **the generator-list producer (C1b)**, which the old C1–C4 sketch
omitted.

#### 9.2.1 Existing C# infra to build on (exact names, all verified present)

| Piece | File · API | Gives the build |
|---|---|---|
| Schreier–Sims back-end | `PermutationGroup.cs` — `AddGenerator(int[])`, `Order:BigInteger`, `Contains`, `Orbit(pt)`, `BasePoints`, `Generators`, `Elements()` | **the |Aut| + base engine** — seed generators, read `Order` = `|Aut|`, `BasePoints` = the base. |
| Route-C group ops | `PermutationGroup.cs` — `RegularNormalPSubgroup(p)`, `NormalClosure(g)`, `HasExponentDividing(p)`; `Perm.Order/Pow/Compose/Inverse/FromCycles` | F1 socle recovery + perm arithmetic for building generators. |
| **F1** additive recovery | `AffineStructureRecovery.cs` — `Recover(PermutationGroup aut,int p,int origin) → AffineStructure{Translations,Origin,P,Dim,Coords[vertex]→(Z_p)^Dim}` | coordinates (mod the `O_p(Aut)` shortcut — see C4). |
| **A1** single-quadratic recovery | `QuadraticFormRecovery.cs` — `RecoverForm(int[] adj,int n,AffineStructure aff) → RecoveredForm{P,Dim,Monomials,Coeffs,Evaluate(v)}` (odd-q; null in char 2) | the `ι=Unit` case of C1. |
| Oracle seam | `ITransversalOracle.cs` — `Classify(n,adj,targetCell,path,PermutationGroup knownGroup) → TransversalDecision{Representatives}` | **where a Route-C oracle plugs in** (soundness: reps cover every orbit of the target cell). |
| Harness / residue seam | `ChainDescent.cs` — target-cell selection + `target == −1` (~L287), `CoveredByPathFixingAut` prune, deferral (~L274–287), `ResidualGroup` | where C3 wires the recovered-`Aut` canonicalisation. |
| Refinement | `WarmPartition.cs`, `RefinementFootprint.cs` | where the recovered-`Q` colouring is injected (the "fine scheme", §9.2.3). |
| Pre-processor template to clone | Tests: `Option2ExtractionProbe.cs`, `TwistConstruction.cs` (Option 2 Layer D — the F₂/rigid mirror) | the architecture to mirror (recover structure → build group → plug the seam). |
| End-to-end validation | Tests: `RouteCF1Probe.cs` (F1+A1 vs the REAL harness: `ResidualGroup` has full `|Aut|`; `Recover`'s `T` exact; `Q`+coords reconstruct the graph, 0 mismatches) | the harness↔F1↔A1 chain, already green. |

**Confirmed absent:** no `ITransversalOracle` implementation for Route C, no family dispatch, no classical-group
generator producer. The Lean `FormAdapter` interface has **no C# counterpart**. This is the whole build.

#### 9.2.2 Pieces to build (named, with interfaces + dependencies)

- **(C1a) `RecoverFormFamily`** — generalize `QuadraticFormRecovery` from one quadratic to a form **family**. New type
  `RecoveredFormFamily{Monomials, Coeffs[][] (one row per basis quadric)}`; `RecoverFormFamily(adj,n,aff)` solves the
  degree-2 vanishing system on the cone and returns a **basis of the vanishing space** (span of quadrics), not just
  `kernel[0]`. Covers Plücker (alt) + spinor (half-spin). Dep: F1 coords. Probe refs: `route_c_halfspin_probe.py`
  (dim 10), `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` (`vanishDim=1` for the single-quadratic case). *Odd-q.*
- **(C1b) `ClassicalGroupGenerators` — THE new load-bearing piece.** Given the recovered form (family) + `AffineStructure`,
  produce a generating set for `AΓO(Q)` (resp. `⨅ₖ O(Q_k)`, Suzuki cone-stab) as **`int[]` permutations of the `p^d`
  vertices**, ready for `PermutationGroup.AddGenerator`. Contents: the **translations** (already have — `AffineStructure.Translations.Generators`), the **linear isometries/reflections** of `Q` (standard classical-group generator list — orthogonal reflections `x ↦ x − (B(x,a)/Q(a))a` realized as vertex permutations via `Coords`), and the **similitude scalings** (`x ↦ c·x` and one non-square-factor similitude — the `AΓO ⊋ AO` part, §9.0a). This is the C# realization of the Lean `similitudeGroup Q` / `affineG`. Dep: C1a. **Lean contract:** the produced group must equal `affineG(similitudeGroup Q)` — i.e. `PermutationGroup.Order` == `p^d · |AΓO^ε_d(q)|` **and** `Contains(AffineStructure.Translations generators)`. **★ ORDER-CHECK DESIGN (2026-07-04, corrected — do NOT hand-derive the closed form as the primary gate):** deriving `|AΓO^ε_d(q)|` by hand is error-prone (the `O^+`/`O^-` parity factor, the `(q−1)` similitude factor, the Frobenius `e` factor). **Bootstrap the check against the harness's OWN harvested `|Aut|`:** at small `d` the generic harvest recovers the *true* `|Aut|` (`RouteCF1Probe.cs` proves this), so C1b's order-check compares `built.Order` against `res.ResidualGroup.Order` for VO±₄(3,5), and only *extrapolates* to the hand-derived closed form once it is validated equal at small `d`. This removes the "checking against a wrong constant" risk and is the acceptance gate = the executable form of the group-pinning theorem `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG`. Anchor the closed form on `|O^ε_{2m}(q)| = 2·q^{m(m−1)}·(q^m−ε)·∏_{i=1}^{m−1}(q^{2i}−1)` (q odd), with the similitude `×~(q−1)` and Frobenius `×e` (q=pᵉ; e=1 for the sealed q=p case) factors pinned against Kleidman–Liebeck AND the harvested order at `d=4`.
- **(C2) `FormsGraphClassifier.Detect(n,adj,aff) → FamilyTag`** — decide which family (affine-polar / alternating /
  half-spin / Suzuki) from SRG parameters `(n,k,λ,μ)` + cone-geometry signature (e.g. VSz(8)=SRG(4096,455,6,56) is the
  Suzuki fingerprint — `route_c_suzuki_probe.py`), select the C1a/C1b variant. C# analog of L3's classification.
- **(C3) residue-seam handler (integration decision (ii), 2026-07-04).** Two integration levels were scoped:
  **(i)** a `RouteCOracle : ITransversalOracle` returning short certified rep-lists (minimal harness change, but the
  reported `|Aut|` still comes from the harness harvest — so it does NOT deliver the `d`-scaling payoff, only fewer
  branches); **(ii)** a handler at the residue seam (`ChainDescent.cs target == −1`, `RecoveryOnly` currently returns
  `StuckResidual`) that runs C2→C1a→C1b, **verifies** (order-check + every generator stabilises `adj`), and if verified
  **adopts the built group** to report `|Aut|` and generate the canonical labelling — instead of flagging/stalling.
  **DECISION: (ii)** — the residue seam is exactly where the generic harvest stalls at large `d`, so it is the honest
  place for the certified path; (i) is the lighter fallback. Soundness: if the build fails to verify (misclassification,
  char-2 gap), the handler declines and the harness falls back to its existing flag — never a wrong answer. The C1b
  order-check is a **unit test independent of this choice**, so C1b can be built and validated before C3 is wired.
- **(C4) `GeometricCoordinatizer` (= §7a R1, the Aut-free path)** — replace `AffineStructureRecovery`'s `O_p(Aut)`
  shortcut (which consumes `Aut`, the potential circularity) with **adjacency-only** recovery: recover the isotropic
  lines through `o` via the local invariant `|N(o)∩N(x)∩N(y)|` (validated Aut-free by `route_c_bootstrap_probe.py`),
  build the polar-space geometry, read coordinates by Buekenhout–Shult; also recovers the field (F2, `q=pᵉ`). Biggest;
  can be last (F1's `O_p(Aut)` path is fine for de-risking/tests). Cite Buekenhout–Shult.

**Suzuki / char-2** is a separate track for C1a/C1b (σ-twisted forms, Arf; `route_c_suzuki_probe.py` has the 5 σ-forms);
the harness wiring (C3) and the classifier (C2) are char-agnostic.

#### 9.2.3 The pipeline + the "augment with recovered `Q`" step

```
abstract graph (residue, target==−1)
  → C2 Detect family
  → C4 GeometricCoordinatizer (or F1 Recover, de-risk path)   → AffineStructure (coords)
  → C1a RecoverFormFamily                                     → RecoveredFormFamily (Q up to scalar)
  → C1b ClassicalGroupGenerators                              → int[] gens of AΓO(Q)
  → PermutationGroup.AddGenerator×… ; .Order = |Aut| ; .BasePoints = base
  → C3 return certified Representatives (Orbit off the known group) + canonical labelling
```

**The "fine scheme" in C# = inject the recovered-`Q` colouring as an extra refinement colour** (colour each pair by
`RecoveredForm.Evaluate(Coords[x]−Coords[y])`, well-defined up to the global scalar) into `WarmPartition` before the
residue branches. This is the runtime realisation of "refine the coarse graph to the fine isometry scheme"; it is the
step that makes the descent discretize (the Lean `SchemeRecoveredByDepth fine`). Optional if C3 supplies the full
known group directly (then orbits are read off the group, not the refined WL) — **prefer C3's group route**; the
colouring-injection is the fallback / cross-check.

#### 9.2.4 Verification (how the builder confirms each piece — no Lean runtime model, so C# is the check)

- **C1a:** recovered family's joint cone == connection set (`Evaluate` all-zero ⟺ adjacent), 0 mismatches (extend
  `RouteCF1Probe.cs`'s reconstruction check to families).
- **C1b (the critical check):** `PermutationGroup` built from the generators has `Order` == the closed-form
  `p^d · |ΓO^ε_d(q)|`, `Contains` the translations, and every generator stabilises the graph (`adj` invariant). This is
  the empirical stand-in for the Skresanov citation — if the *generated* group already has the full order and stabilises
  the graph, the |Aut| answer is correct regardless of the 2-closure proof.
- **C3:** end-to-end — the canonizer returns the same labelling for isomorphic copies (extend the iso-stability bed) and
  `|Aut|` matches the closed form, on VO^±₄(3,5), Alt(5,q), VSz(8).
- Probes already validating inputs: `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py`, `route_c_f1_probe.py`, `route_c_halfspin_probe.py`,
  `route_c_suzuki_probe.py`, `route_c_bootstrap_probe.py` (C4).

#### 9.2.5 Lean contracts the C# must honour (the spec is not free-floating)

- `ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG` — **the group C1b builds IS `affineG(similitudeGroup Q)`**;
  its `Order` is `|AΓO(Q)|·p^d`. This is the correctness target for C1b.
- `ScratchRecoveredFormTransfer.routeC_polySupport` — the triple (coarse Aut = known group ∧ fine harvest ∧ fine refines
  coarse); C1b delivers (i), the colouring-injection (§9.2.3) delivers (ii)/(iii).
- The `FormAdapter` instances (`affinePolarAdapter`, `…_alternating`, `…_halfSpin`, `…_suzuki`) — each family's
  `separates` certificate; C1a/C1b are their runtime mirror (the form + its group).

**Ordering:** C1a → C1b (+ its order-check) → C2 → C3 (end-to-end) → C4 last. C1b is the load-bearing new piece and the
first to build; everything else is plumbing or already exists. The engine is the **symmetric mirror of Option 2's Layer
D** (clone `Option2ExtractionProbe.cs`/`TwistConstruction.cs`, swapping the F₂ extractor for `RecoverFormFamily`).
[[project_recovery_corecovery_duality_2026-07-03]].

#### 9.2.6 Lean adherence — what's backed vs. new territory (be explicit)

The C# splits into **Lean-backed** pieces (a faithful runtime of a proved theorem) and **new-territory** pieces
(correct + useful, but *not* backed by a Lean theorem — fine, as long as it is labelled). The build is applicable to
the Lean where it counts (the `|Aut|` answer is certified by a proved theorem) and honestly new everywhere the Lean was
never going to reach.

| C# piece | Status | Lean anchor / why not |
|---|---|---|
| **C1b built group == answer group** | **HARD contract (Lean-backed, tightest)** | `schemeAutGroup_coarse_eq_affineG` — answer group is *exactly* `affineG(similitudeGroup Q)` mod the Skresanov citation. A proper subgroup (forgetting the similitude scalings = AO not AΓO) or supergroup (spurious gens) both fail the order-check. **The order-check IS the executable form of the group-pinning theorem.** |
| **C1a null-when-kernel≠1** | Lean-backed (soft) | `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` — `RecoverForm` returning null on kernel-dim≠1 is the runtime check of the citation's `vanishDim=1` hypothesis. |
| **C3 orbit reps + labelling** | Lean-backed (soft) | oracle soundness (reps one-per-orbit) + F4 `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` + brick-1 `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` (iso-invariance of the labelling). |
| **F1 / C4 coordinatization** | **NEW territory — NOT Lean-backed** | the Lean *starts* from the already-coordinatized `affineScheme`; recovering `(F_p)^d` from the abstract graph (socle / geometric) has no Lean model. A computation the proof assumes done. |
| **The "poly" claim** | **NEW / META — cannot be Lean-backed** | per the §9.0a vacuity correction, poly is inherently a meta-claim (any coarse-scheme predicate is vacuous-or-false). The C# runtime is the closest evidence; it discharges no Lean obligation. |
| **C2 classifier** | NEW (safe) | C# analog of the L3 classification citation; a runtime heuristic. Misclassification is *safe* (wrong family → wrong group → order mismatch → handler declines → harness flags), just not complete. |
| **Char-2 / Suzuki recovery** | NEW (separate track) | `suzukiAdapter` is sealed in Lean, but the C# char-2 form recovery (Arf, not the degree-2 kernel solve) is unbuilt; `RecoverForm` already returns null for `p==2`. |

**One-line takeaway:** rigid Lean↔C# coupling at exactly one point (C1b = group-pinning, checked by the order gate);
soft coupling at C1a + C3; everything else (coordinatization, poly, classification, char-2) is legitimately outside the
Lean. That is the *expected* shape — the Lean proves *correctness of the group answer*, and leaves *"recover the
structure"* and *"poly runtime"* as the meta/engineering layer.

#### 9.2.7 The FAMILY-DISPATCH architecture (built 2026-07-04) — how the four families interconnect

Node 4 = four families; each is an **`IFormFamilyHandler`** (the C# mirror of the Lean `FormAdapter` engine), and
`RouteCCanonicalizer` dispatches over a registry. **Affine-polar is fully built; the other three are handlers with all
interconnection LIVE and only their per-family math core stubbed** — so a future builder fills a well-defined stub, not
a green field. Files: `FormFamilyHandler.cs` (interface + generic `FormFamilyHandlerBase<TInv>` + generalized
`RouteCCanonicalResult` + shared helpers), `AffinePolarHandler.cs` (real), `AlternatingHandler.cs` / `HalfSpinHandler.cs`
/ `SuzukiHandler.cs` (scaffolds). Tests: `RouteCFamilyDispatchProbe.cs` (regression through the dispatch + stubs decline
gracefully; 114/114 with the core suite).

**The four hooks each handler implements** (the base wires the flow: `RecognizeInvariant` → `Confirm` → emit
`StandardGraph` + `AutOrder`):
| Hook | What it does | Shared vs per-family |
|---|---|---|
| `RecognizeInvariant(adj,n)` | HARVEST-FREE iso-type from `(n, valency, SRG params)`; `null` ⟹ not this family (dormant) | per-family fingerprint |
| `Confirm(adj,n,harvest,inv)` | SAFETY: rules out a parameter-mate SRG | **odd-q families SHARE `ConfirmByMultiQuadricReconstruction` (C1a) — already wired**; Suzuki = char-2 (per-family) |
| `StandardGraph(inv)` | the canonical standard graph of the iso-type (emitted canonical form) | per-family construction |
| `AutOrder(inv)` | closed-form `|Aut|` of the iso-type | per-family formula |

**Safety invariant:** a dormant handler's `RecognizeInvariant` returns `null`, so its `NotImplementedException` cores are
never reached — the graph falls back to the descent. Activating `RecognizeInvariant` forces completing `StandardGraph` +
`AutOrder` (their throws fire otherwise) — a crisp completion contract.

**Per-family completion specs (the well-defined remaining work):**
- **Alternating** (`AlternatingHandler`, Lean `reachesRigidOrCameron_alternating`, Plücker sub-Pfaffians, odd q,
  multi-quadric): `Confirm` DONE (multi-quadric). TODO = (1) SRG fingerprint + params→iso-type; (2) `StandardGraph` =
  canonical alternating forms graph (joint zero of the standard Plücker quadrics); (3) `AutOrder` = alternating
  similitude group order.
- **Half-spin** (`HalfSpinHandler`, Lean `reachesRigidOrCameron_halfSpin`, 10 D₅ spinor quadrics `S0..S9`, odd q,
  multi-quadric): same shape as alternating. `Confirm` DONE. TODO = fingerprint + `StandardGraph` (spinor quadrics) +
  `AutOrder` (half-spin/spin group order). Probe `route_c_halfspin_probe.py` (dim 10).
- **Suzuki–Tits** (`SuzukiHandler`, Lean `reachesRigidOrCameron_suzuki`, CITATION-FREE, char-2): recognition LIVE for
  VSz(8)=SRG(4096,455,6,56). TODO = (1) generalize the fingerprint to `Sz(q)`, `q=2^{2e+1}`; (2) `Confirm` = char-2 form
  recovery (Arf / σ-twisted ovoid forms via the `GF(q)^4↔𝔽₂^d` bridge + second-derivative recovery — does NOT reuse the
  odd-q `RecoverFormFamily`); (3) `StandardGraph` = canonical `Sz(q)` ovoid graph; (4) `AutOrder` = `q^4·|Sz(q)|·factors`,
  `|Sz(q)| = q²(q²+1)(q−1)`. Probes `route_c_suzuki_probe.py` / `_determine_probe.py`.

**Note — C1b (`ClassicalGroupGenerators`) is odd-q single-quadratic only; the multi-form / char-2 group generators are
NOT needed for the runtime** (|Aut| comes from the closed-form `AutOrder`), only for an optional order-check verification
test — so they are off the completion critical path for each family.

**★ SLOT AUDIT (2026-07-04) — the 4-hook interface is COMPLETE for all four families; no missing slot.** Suzuki is an
outlier only in *implementation* (char-2/Arf inside its `Confirm`, and the `GF(q)⁴↔𝔽₂^d` module bridge inside
recovery/construction) — not in *interface shape*; even char-2 coordinatization is the shared `Coordinatize` (F1 works
for p=2). Two audit-driven refinements landed: (a) **`AffinePolarHandler` is now explicitly odd-q scoped** (declines
`q==2` at recognition) so **char-2 affine-polar** (Clebsch = VO⁻₄(2)) is a *clean separate slot*, exactly like Suzuki —
rather than a "recognized-but-always-declines" oddity; (b) a shared **`FormsGraphBuilder.StandardCayleyGraph(q, dim,
diff => …)`** builder (used by `StandardVO`, referenced in every stub's `StandardGraph` TODO) makes each family's
`StandardGraph` a near one-liner once its standard forms are known. Net: **five clean slots** — the four families plus a
char-2-affine-polar branch — each completed by filling fingerprint + `StandardGraph` (via the shared builder) + `AutOrder`
(+ char-2 `Confirm` for the two char-2 slots).

### 9.3 Later — the meta-poly rigor stage

The §7a residuals R1–R3 (build the geometric coordinatizer, name Buekenhout–Shult + its poly bound, double-check
`d=4` GQ) and, at the far end, the C#-design-into-Lean runtime model that makes "poly" (nearly) rigorous rather
than a meta-argument. This is the project's planned final stage; nothing above blocks on it.

### 9.4 Suggested ordering
1. Finish Suzuki (all four sealed).
2. **L1 spot-check** (are the four `reachesRigidOrCameron` disjuncts iso-invariant?) — cheap, de-risks the whole
   combination; do before L2.
3. L1 → L2/L3 → L4 (the clean Lean object), in parallel with C1–C3 (the runtime).
4. C4 + the R1–R3 / meta-poly rigor stage last.
