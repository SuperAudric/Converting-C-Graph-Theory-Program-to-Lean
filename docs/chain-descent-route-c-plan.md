# Route C — the constructive form-recovery route to a POLYNOMIAL forms-graph canonizer

> **What this is.** The self-contained build plan for **Route C**: proving the affine forms-graph residue is
> canonized in **polynomial** time by *recovering the defining algebraic structure* (the form/geometry) from the
> abstract graph and then using its **known** automorphism group — instead of driving Weisfeiler–Leman refinement to
> orbits. Route C **sidesteps the node-4 WL-dimension wall** that closed the direct recovery route
> ([`chain-descent-recovery-route.md`](./chain-descent-recovery-route.md) §9.8.9). This doc is the staging point: a
> fresh reader should be able to read it and build forward. It carries the plan, the knowledge foundation, the exact
> names of the preexisting lemmas Route C rides on, and the probe evidence.
>
> **Relation to the other docs.** The SEAL (correctness disjunction `reachesRigidOrCameron`) is **already banked at
> quasipoly** and is *not* Route C's job. The direct WL/poly routes (A/B, `bᵢ=1` via `ColorRefinesGramK`) **STALLED**
> at the node-4 wall — full verdict in the recovery doc §9.8.9. Route C is the **bounded, guaranteed-poly alternative**
> that route pointed to. The forms-graph plan ([`chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md`](./chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md))
> §11.4/§11.5 has the per-family (alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits / char-2) analysis this doc's architecture generalizes.

## STATUS (read first)

**Where Route C stands (2026-07-03).** The **recovery front is built and confirmed**; the Route-C spine is assembled
from landed pieces; **F4's equivariance core is now LANDED (axiom-clean)** — the residual reduces to A1's finite-geometry
uniqueness (`ConeSepDeterminesForm`, now named + carried as a classical citation) + the meta poly claim + the
bootstrapping question (how coordinates are recovered without already having `Aut`; see the "OPEN — meta-poly" note).

**✅ DONE — the C# recovery front (abstract graph → coordinates → form → graph), confirmed against the REAL harness.**
- **F1 — additive-structure recovery** (`PermutationGroup.RegularNormalPSubgroup` + `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover`):
  `T = O_p(Aut)` (the socle) recovers the regular elementary-abelian translations `≅ (𝔽_p)^d`, and a basis coordinatizes
  the vertices. Probe `route_c_f1_probe.py` (algorithm) + `RouteCF1Probe.cs` (production, vs the real `ResidualGroup`,
  ground-truth exact).
- **A1 — form recovery** (`QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`): recovers `Q` up to scalar by ONE degree-2 kernel solve
  on the cone. Probe `route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` (`vanishDim=1` all ε/d/q) + `RouteCF1Probe.cs`: the recovered `Q` +
  coords **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])=0 ⟺ x~y`, **0 mismatches**, VO^±₄(3), VO^±₄(5)).
- Both odd-q and char-2 for F1 (full `Aut` delivered); A1 is odd-q (char-2 = separate Arf track). All C# tests green,
  existing `PermutationGroup` tests unaffected.

**✅ DONE — the Lean spine (`ChainDescent/ScratchRouteC.lean`, all axiom-clean, NOT in `build.sh`).**
- `coords_determine_spanning` + `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` — the **spanning-base** generalization
  of the landed `coords_determine`/`viaOrthogonalForm`: the isometry scheme `O(Q)` discretizes at ANY base whose
  differences span (Route C individualizes an iso-invariantly chosen base, not the literal standard frame).
- `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` (**A3 brick 1**) — `O(Q)≤GO(Q)` ⟹ the isometry scheme (exact-`Q` relations)
  refines the given similitude graph (isotropy-only). The consistency half of the bridge.
- **F4 equivariance core (NEW 2026-07-03, axiom-clean):** `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` — the linear part `g` of
  a graph iso carries the `Q`-cone to the `Q'`-cone, hence (via the carried `ConeSepDeterminesForm`) the recovered
  **difference colouring** transports by one global scalar: `Q'(g u − g t) = μ · Q(u − t)`. Provable bricks
  `similitude_colouring_equivariant` (the equivariance identity) + `similitude_conePreserving` (cone consistency); the
  one non-elementary link is `ConeSepDeterminesForm` (below).
- **The assembled spine:** recover `Q` (F1+A1, C# done) → work on the finer isometry scheme (refines the given graph,
  brick 1) → discretize at a spanning base (`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning`, landed) → the whole thing is iso-invariant
  (F4). **Discreteness does NOT transfer down to the similitude scheme** (that's the node-4 stall) — so Route C is a
  *distinct canonicalization object*, and F4 supplies exactly the iso-invariance that makes "discrete ⟹ canonical".

**◻ REMAINING — the classical carry, the meta claim, and the bootstrapping question.**
- **`ConeSepDeterminesForm` (A1's Lean side = F4's one non-elementary link):** "a nondegenerate quadric determines its
  quadratic form up to a nonzero scalar" (the `vanishDim=1` fact, probe-confirmed). **Correction to the earlier "only F4
  remains":** F4 and A1's Lean lemma are *two faces of this one classical fact* — F4 now names + carries it (Witt/G3
  discipline) and proves the equivariance around it; discharging it (a finite-geometry development) or accepting it as a
  citation is the remaining Lean choice. Not vacuous: it is scoped (the unrestricted `∀ Q R` form is false).
- **Meta poly claim:** "poly" stays a meta-argument over the bounded-base discreteness object + poly per-node (no runtime
  model in Lean).
- **★ OPEN — meta-poly bootstrapping (spotted 2026-07-03, not yet resolved):** F1 as built/documented recovers
  coordinates from `T = O_p(Aut)` — it **consumes `Aut`**. But poly-time computation of `Aut` for this SRG residue is
  *itself* the open T0 problem Route C claims to sidestep, so the meta-poly first step is potentially circular. The
  in-spirit fix (recover the affine/geometric coordinatization directly from the cone/line structure, no `Aut`) is
  plausible + poly for these highly-structured graphs but is **neither built nor scoped**. The Lean object (F4) is
  unaffected (Lean formalizes no runtime model); this is a gap in the *poly claim*, to resolve in the cost analysis.
- **Later:** `q=pᵉ` (F2, the Frobenius seam), and the other families (alternating/half-spin/Suzuki) as `IFormStructure`
  adapters — §6 "Instances 2–4".

**▶ VERIFY what's landed (fresh-reader commands):**
- Lean: `cd GraphCanonizationProofs && lake env lean ChainDescent/ScratchRouteC.lean` (exit 0, clean). Axiom-check by
  appending `#print axioms ChainDescent.RouteC.<name>` and re-running (expect `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
- C#: `cd GraphCanonizationProject.Tests && dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RouteCF1Probe.F1_Recovers_TranslationGroup&Category!=LongRunning"`
  (fast, q=2,3; the `_Large` q=5 cases are `LongRunning`, ~5 min each — canonizer cost, not F1/A1).
- Python probes: `cd GraphCanonizationProofs && python3 route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` / `route_c_f1_probe.py`.

**Quality bar (project-wide):** every Lean theorem axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; no `sorry`,
no fresh `axiom`; `native_decide` banned; full build green when ported. "Poly time" stays a **meta-argument** (the
project formalizes no runtime model): the structural deliverables are the seal disjunction `reachesRigidOrCameron`
(banked) and the *bounded-base discreteness object* Route C constructs; "poly" is the meta-claim over that + poly
per-node.

---

## 1. The claim, and why Route C

**The claim.** The abstract forms graph determines its defining form `Q` (up to scalar) by elementary linear algebra;
its automorphism group is then the **known** affine similitude group `AΓO^ε(Q)`, whose canonicalization is standard
poly group theory (Schreier–Sims — already implemented, §4). No WL-reaches-orbits, no count crux.

**Why Route C (the wall it dodges).** The direct routes canonize by driving refinement to the orbit partition. On the
forms graph the descent runs on the **similitude SRG**, whose relations record only the **isotropy class** of a
difference (zero / nonzero-isotropic / anisotropic), *not* the exact `Q`-value. Recovering the exact bilinear values
from bounded-base isotropy counts is the **node-4 WL-dimension wall** — open both ways, and it closed the direct build
(`ColorRefinesGramK` is circular; the round-2 colouring is a character-handleless "count of counts"; the FLAG lead is
negative — recovery doc §9.8.9). Route C reads `Q` off the cone **directly** (the cone is an iso-invariant of the
graph; the degree-2 form vanishing on it is canonical up to scalar), so it never touches that wall.

**Where it sits.** Banked quasipoly seal `AffinePolarSeal.reachesRigidOrCameron_affinePolar` = the floor (correctness).
Route C = the poly-cost upgrade for the forms-graph residue. It is a **larger build + a behavioural change** (a
structure-recovery pre-processor); pursue it *because* the lighter WL route stalled, not before.

---

## 2. Knowledge foundation

### 2a. The object
- **Graph.** `V = K^d` (`K = 𝔽_q`, `q = p^e`, `d = 2m`); adjacency `Q(x − y) = 0` for a nondegenerate quadratic form
  `Q` of type `ε` — the affine-polar forms graph `VO^ε_{2m}(q)`. A translation (Cayley) scheme ⟹ vertex-transitive,
  schurian, primitive rank-3 SRG.
- **Automorphisms.** `Aut = ` translations `⋊ ΓO^ε(Q)` (affine similitudes: linear maps `g` with `Q(gx) = μ(g)·σ(Q(x))`
  for a scalar `μ` and a field automorphism `σ`; for prime `q`, just `GO^ε(Q)`, no field twist). `|Aut|` is huge (e.g.
  `VO⁻₄(3)`: `233280 = 3⁴·|GO⁻₄(3)|`) — the graph is far from rigid, which is *why* the harvest keeps branching small.
- **The two forms `make_Q` uses** (probe ground truth): `ε=+1`: `Σᵢ x_{2i}x_{2i+1}` (hyperbolic); `ε=−1`:
  `Σ x_{2i}x_{2i+1} + x_{d-2}² − g·x_{d-1}²` with `g` = least non-square (elliptic).
- **Skresanov isolation.** The seal's residue is the schurian affine slice `{1-dim cyclotomic (cited) + forms-graphs
  (c)–(f)}`; Route C's recovery is needed on (c)–(f) `{affine-polar / alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits}`.

### 2b. Why the cone determines `Q` (the algebra that dodges the wall)
The connection set from the origin is the punctured isotropic cone `C = {x ≠ 0 : Q(x) = 0}`. The homogeneous degree-2
forms vanishing on `C` form a vector space; for a nondegenerate quadric with `d ≥ 3` and non-tiny `q` that space is
**1-dimensional = ⟨Q⟩** (a classical finite-geometry fact; probe-confirmed dim `= 1` with no exceptions in range).
So `Q` is recovered by ONE linear solve over the `d(d+1)/2` degree-2 monomials — poly, non-circular (no WL, no orbits).
The cone only fixes `Q` **up to scalar `μ`**, but that is exactly right: `O(Q) = O(μQ)` and `GO(Q) = GO(μQ)`, so the
recovered object is well-defined, and in the refined colouring the global `μ` cancels in every comparison.

### 2c. The honest subtlety — isometry scheme vs. the given similitude graph
The landed `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm` (§4) seals `affineScheme (isometryGroup Q)` — the **isometry**
scheme `O(Q)`, whose relations are the **exact** `Q`-value of a difference. But the *given graph* is
`affineScheme (similitudeGroup Q)` — the **similitude** scheme `GO(Q)`, whose relations are only the isotropy class
(`∃ g∈GO(Q), g(u−t)=u'−t ⟺ isoClass(u−t)=isoClass(u'−t)`). At any bounded base the isotropy profile does **not**
jointly-separate — that is the stall. So Route C's load-bearing new content is **not** "invoke `viaOrthogonalForm`";
it is:

> **The recovered form `Q` refines the similitude graph to the isometry scheme.** Colour each pair `(t, z)` by `Q(z − t)`
> (well-defined up to the *global* scalar `μ`, which cancels in comparisons). That refined colouring is (i)
> **iso-invariant** (a graph iso carries the cone to the cone, hence `Q` to a scalar multiple), and (ii) **discretizes
> at a spanning base** via `coords_determine` / `spanning_sameExactGram_determines`.

`coords_determine` and the spanning generalization are landed; the refinement bridge + its iso-invariance are the new
lemmas (A3 / F4 in §6).

---

## 3. The architecture — 1 engine + N adapters (the merge)

The families **merge at the "recovered structure → iso-invariant refining data on `V`" boundary**. Once a family hands
the generic engine (a) the recovered form as a colouring of pairs and (b) a "form-values-at-a-base determine the vertex"
certificate, everything downstream is shared. So Route C is **one generic engine + a small `IFormStructure` interface
with 4 implementations** — *not* four separate objects, and *not* one monolith with four branches.

**Merge boundaries — what is shared vs. family-specific:**

| layer | shared (1 impl) | family-specific (N adapters) |
|---|---|---|
| additive/affine recovery (F1) | ✅ `T = O_p(Aut)` — identical for all | — |
| 𝔽_q-scalar recovery (F2) | ✅ | — |
| the generic engine (refine-by-φ, canonical base, discretize) — F3/F5 | ✅ | — |

Affine-polar / alternating / half-spin share ~all of `RecoverForm` and `Separates` (all recover a bilinear/quadratic
form and separate by polar-nondegeneracy). **Suzuki–Tits is the one genuinely-different adapter** (non-form σ-twisted
ovoid, char-2 — same interface, different internals; folds into the char-2 track, plan §11.5).

## 4. The preexisting foundation Route C rides on (exact names)

### Lean — LANDED & AXIOM-CLEAN (the back-half + the generic spine)

| `RouteC.coords_determine_spanning` | `ScratchRouteC.lean` (**Route C, NEW, axiom-clean**) | spanning generalization of `coords_determine`: `Q`-values at any *spanning* base `S` (`span S = ⊤`) determine the vertex |
| `RouteC.reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` | `ScratchRouteC.lean` (**Route C, NEW, axiom-clean**) | spanning generalization of `viaOrthogonalForm`: `O(Q)` discretizes at any base `T∋o` whose differences `{t̄−ō}` span — the iso-invariantly-chosen base Route C needs |

### C# — EXISTS (the group back-end + the seam + the pre-processor template)
In `GraphCanonizationProject/`.

| file | what it gives Route C |
|---|---|
| `PermutationGroup.cs` | **full Schreier–Sims** — stabilizer chain, `AddGenerator`, `Order`, `Contains`, `Orbit`, `BasePoints`, `IsAbelian`, `IsElementaryAbelian`. **+ Route-C F1 ops (NEW 2026-07-03):** `RegularNormalPSubgroup(p)` (the socle/translations), `NormalClosure`, `Elements`, `HasExponentDividing`, `Perm.Order`/`Pow` |
| `AffineStructureRecovery.cs` | **Route C, NEW 2026-07-03** — `Recover(aut, p, origin)` = F1's entry point: socle `T` + `Dim` + vertex→`(𝔽_p)^Dim` coordinate map (via `T`'s regular action). Confirmed by `RouteCF1Probe.cs` |
| `QuadraticFormRecovery.cs` | **Route C, NEW 2026-07-03 (A1)** — `RecoverForm(adj, n, aff)`: recovers `Q` up to scalar by the degree-2 kernel solve on the cone; `RecoveredForm.Evaluate`. The quadratic family's `RecoverForm`. Odd-q; confirmed to reconstruct the whole graph |

## 5. The probes (what is already validated, and how to re-run)

All in `GraphCanonizationProofs/` (pure Python, `python3 <file>`; reuse `model_gap.py` helpers `make_Q`/`sub`/`polar`/
`isoclass`/`add`).

- **`route_c_reconstruct_probe.py` — A1 (form recovery).** For each `(ε,d,q)`, builds the isotropic cone and computes
  the rank of the degree-2 vanishing system. **Result: `vanishDim = 1` everywhere** (ε=±, d=4,6,8, q=3,5,7,11) ⟹ `Q`
  reconstructible up to scalar by one linear solve, no small-`q` exception. (Odd `q`; char-2 is a separate track — over
  `𝔽_{2^k}` squaring collapses degree, so the degree-2 vanishing space differs; handled by the Arf/char-2 substrate.)
- **`route_c_f1_probe.py` — F1 (additive-structure recovery).** Builds `VO^ε₄(q)` with true translations + monomial
  isometries, **scrambles** by a random relabelling, then recovers `O_p` via normal closures with **no ground-truth
  reference**. **Result (VO^ε₄(3), VO^ε₄(5), both types): `Op == T` exactly, regular, elementary-abelian, and the
  recovered coordinates give `coneVanishDim = 1`** ⟹ recovery is method-correct, scramble-invariant, and hands A1 a
  valid coordinatization. (Odd `q`: `−1` is a `p'`-element so `G₀` is a `p'`-group and `O_p(G)=T` is clean; char-2
  recovers `T` the same way but needs Aut's `p'`-part, e.g. `S₅` for Clebsch.)
- **`RouteCF1Probe.cs` — F1 + A1 against the REAL harness (C#, `GraphCanonizationProject.Tests/`).** Builds `VO^ε₄(q)`,
  runs the actual chain-descent canonizer, and confirms end-to-end (via the **production** methods) that (I)
  `CanonResult.ResidualGroup` contains the translations and has full `|Aut|`, (II) `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover`'s
  translation group equals `T` **exactly** (ground-truth), regular + elementary-abelian, and (III)
  `QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`'s `Q` + those coordinates **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])
  =0 ⟺ x~y`, 0 mismatches). **All pass** (q=2,3 fast, both types; q=5 `LongRunning`). Confirms the harness↔F1↔A1 chain.
- **Supporting (from the direct route, still relevant):** `model_gap.py` (the isoClass scheme + orbit/refinement
  helpers), `factorization_probe.py`/`flag_stall_probe.py` (the node-4 stall evidence that motivates Route C).

## 6. The build plan

### Foundation (must exist before the family builds)

| # | piece | side | status / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | **Additive/affine recovery** — `T = O_p(Aut)` (the socle), a basis → coordinates, any vertex → origin | C#+Lean | **✅ CONFIRMED + PRODUCTIONIZED (2026-07-03).** Confirmed against the REAL harness (`RouteCF1Probe.cs`): recovers `T` exactly (ground-truth), regular + elementary-abelian, coordinatizes the cone (`vanishDim=1`) — VO^ε₄(q), q=2,3,5, both types; char-agnostic (full `Aut` delivered). **Production code landed:** general group ops on `PermutationGroup.cs` (`RegularNormalPSubgroup(p)`, `NormalClosure`, `Elements`, `HasExponentDividing`, `Perm.Order`/`Pow`) + `AffineStructureRecovery.Recover` (coordinatization); the probe now exercises the production path (all pass; 26 existing `PermutationGroup` tests green). "`soc = O_p = T`" = the affine-primitive **socle theorem** (cite). Remaining: the Lean side (F4 iso-invariance) + `q=pᵉ` (F2). |
| **F2** | **𝔽_q-scalar recovery** (q=pᵉ) — recover the field/Frobenius structure (the ΓL/semilinear seam) | C#+Lean | **new; deferrable.** `q=p` needs nothing (additive = 𝔽_p-linear automatically). `FieldGeneric`/`efield` = the template; same seam the WL route had (plan Layer D) |
| **F3** | **`IFormStructure` interface + generic engine** (refine-by-φ, canonical base, discretize) | C# | new, thin; the merge point |
| **F4** | **Iso-invariance of the recovered `φ`** — the `forcedNode_relabel` analog: `RecoverForm` is relabeling-equivariant up to scalar | Lean | **✅ EQUIVARIANCE CORE LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean`):** `recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` (+ bricks `similitude_colouring_equivariant`/`similitude_conePreserving`).

### Instance 1 — affine-polar `VO^ε` (proves the whole spine)

| # | piece | status |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | `RecoverForm` = solve the degree-2 vanishing system on the cone | **✅ CONFIRMED + PRODUCTIONIZED (2026-07-03, `QuadraticFormRecovery.RecoverForm`):** recovers `Q` up to scalar by one kernel solve on F1's coordinates; the recovered `Q` + coords **reconstruct the entire graph** (`Q(coords[x]−coords[y])=0 ⟺ x~y`, **0 mismatches**, VO^±₄(3)). Odd-q (returns null in char-2). Lean side = a finite-geometry nondegeneracy lemma (`⟨Q⟩` = the vanishing space) |
| **A2** | `Separates` = `coords_determine` / `spanning_sameExactGram_determines` | **LANDED, axiom-clean** |
| **A2⁺** | the spanning back-half — `RouteC.coords_determine_spanning` + `RouteC.reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` (isometry scheme discretizes at any iso-invariantly-chosen spanning base) | **✅ LANDED 2026-07-03, axiom-clean** (`ScratchRouteC.lean`, NOT in `build.sh`) |
| **A3** | **the refinement bridge** — recovered `Q` upgrades the similitude graph to the isometry scheme, which `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` discretizes | **◑ brick 1 LANDED (2026-07-03, axiom-clean, `ScratchRouteC.lean`):** `isometryScheme_refines_similitudeScheme` — `O(Q)≤GO(Q)` ⟹ the isometry scheme (exact-`Q` relations) refines the given similitude graph (isotropy-only). The consistency half. Remaining A3 content = the discreteness-transfer, now discharged by **F4** (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant`, ✅ landed 2026-07-03) — the iso-invariance that makes "discrete ⟹ canonical" |
| **A4** | `AutGens` = `GO(Q)` generators (reflections) → existing `PermutationGroup` (only for the \|Aut\| side) | Schreier–Sims exists; generator list is standard classical-group data |

Instance 1 forces F1/F3/F4/F5 into existence, so it is **most of the total work**; the other three families then
reduce to writing their `IFormStructure` implementation.

### Instances 2–4 — reuse the engine, write only the adapter (plan §11.4/§11.5)
- **Alternating (d):** `RecoverForm` recovers an alternating bilinear `B`; `Separates` = the symplectic analog of
  `coords_determine` (radical-nondegeneracy). ~90% shared. *Medium.*
- **Half-spin (e):** form-adjacent spinor incidence; expect `RecoverForm`/`Separates` close to affine-polar. *Medium–high.*
- **Suzuki–Tits (f):** the outlier — `RecoverForm` recovers the σ-twisted ovoid polynomial (char-2), `AutGens = Sz(q)`.
  Same interface, mostly-new internals; folds into the char-2 track. *Hardest; do last.*

### C# / Lean split, and the reuse to exploit
- **The C# engine is the symmetric mirror of Option 2's Layer D** (IR doc §11.10, built through D-M4 as a Phase-2
  pre-processor: recover structure → refine/solve → plug the existing seam). **Clone that architecture**, swapping
  `IFormStructure` for the F₂ extractor. This is the payoff of the recovery↔co-recovery duality
  ([[project_recovery_corecovery_duality_2026-07-03]]): the two pre-processors share a skeleton.
- **Lean deliverable is the poly-supporting structural object**, not a runtime proof: "the recovered-form-refined
  scheme discretizes at an iso-invariantly-constructible `O(d)` base" (F5 + A3), with "poly" the meta-claim over that
  bounded base + the existing Schreier–Sims meta-cost (same discipline as Part A's `Order = ∏ orbit sizes`).

### Sequencing & risks (updated 2026-07-03)
1. ✅ **F1 + A1** (C# recovery front) — DONE + confirmed against the real harness (`AffineStructureRecovery`,
   `QuadraticFormRecovery`, `RouteCF1Probe.cs`).
2. ✅ **A2⁺ + A3 brick 1** (Lean spine from landed pieces) — DONE, axiom-clean (`ScratchRouteC.lean`).
3. ✅ **F4** equivariance core — **LANDED 2026-07-03, axiom-clean** (`recoveredForm_colouring_equivariant` + bricks).
   Residual = the carried `ConeSepDeterminesForm` (A1 uniqueness) + meta-poly bootstrapping (STATUS "OPEN").
4. ◻ **Meta-poly bootstrapping** (NEW next priority) — resolve the F1 circularity: Aut-free geometric coordinatization,
   or a citation that `Aut` is poly-computable for the geometric SRG residue. This gates the "poly" headline (STATUS).
5. ◻ **F2** (`q=pᵉ` seam) — deferrable; the same Layer-D seam the WL route had.
6. ◻ **Instances 2→3→4** — pure adapters; Suzuki last (needs the char-2 substrate as its own prerequisite).

**Definition of done (Route C, affine-polar):** F1 recovers coordinates iso-invariantly (F4 ✅ equivariance core); A1
recovers `Q` (C# ✅; Lean uniqueness = the carried `ConeSepDeterminesForm`); A3 refines to the isometry scheme (brick 1
✅); `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` discretizes at the `O(d)` base and seals via `viaSpielman` (✅) — the structural
bounded-base discreteness object complete, "poly" the meta-claim over it **modulo the bootstrapping question**. The C#
engine reproduces `|Aut|` via `PermutationGroup`. **The Lean spine is now assembled;** the open items are the classical
carry + the meta-poly bootstrapping.

### 6a. F4 — iso-invariance of the recovered form (the next concrete step, for a fresh reader)

**What F4 is.** The recovered `Q` (and hence F1's coordinates and the isometry-scheme colouring) must be a *canonical
function of the graph*: a graph isomorphism `σ` must carry the recovered structure of `G` to the recovered structure of
`σ(G)` (up to the scalar ambiguity of `Q`). Concretely, the connection set (cone) is carried to the connection set, so
the degree-2 form vanishing on it is carried to a scalar multiple — the recovered-`Q` difference colouring is
relabeling-**equivariant**. This is what makes "canonicalize via the recovered form" produce a *canonical* labelling
(the same up to iso), i.e. it is the iso-invariance the poly canonicalization claim needs.

**Why it's the last load-bearing piece.** The spine (recover → isometry scheme → discretize) is assembled: brick 1 says
the isometry scheme refines the given graph; `viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` says it discretizes. What is *not* yet Lean-
certified is that the isometry scheme used is derived *iso-invariantly* from the given graph — without which "discrete"
does not give "canonical". F4 supplies exactly that. (Discreteness does not transfer down to the similitude scheme — the
node-4 stall — so F4 is genuinely needed; it is not implied by the banked seal.)

**The template to mirror (landed).** The symmetry-phase iso-invariant-node machinery in `Cascade.lean`:
`forcedNode` (`:2752`), `forcedNode_image` (`:2830`, image under an automorphism), `movedSet_relabel` (`:3004`),
`forcedNode_relabel` (`:3024`, equivariance under an arbitrary relabelling). F4 is the *form-recovery* analog:
`recoveredForm(σ • G) = σ • recoveredForm(G)` (up to scalar). State it against the abstract-graph relabelling the same
way `forcedNode_relabel` does.

**Risk — the vacuity trap (cf. `SchemeReproduced`, memory `project_...`).** Make the equivariant predicate strong enough
to be *useful* (it must actually pin the colouring iso-invariantly) yet true (holds for the real recovery). Check
non-vacuity against the C# ground truth (`RouteCF1Probe.cs` already exhibits the recovered `Q` reconstructing the graph —
the semantic content F4 formalizes).

**How it composes (the end state).** F4 (equivariant recovery) + brick 1 (isometry refines the graph) +
`viaOrthogonalForm_spanning` (isometry discretizes at a spanning base) ⟹ the graph has an iso-invariant discrete
colouring at an `O(d)` base ⟹ (meta) poly canonical labelling. That is the Route-C deliverable for affine-polar.

## 7. Honest scope — what Route C does and does NOT do
- **Does:** upgrade the **forms-graph** residue from the banked quasipoly seal to **polynomial**, family by family,
  via a shared engine. Sidesteps the node-4 WL wall entirely (recovery is linear algebra, not WL).
- **Does NOT:** touch the **rigid mirror** (the IR-solver **row 4** / multipede / non-schurian residue). There is no
  large classical group to recover there — Route C is structurally inapplicable. That residue is Option 2's job
  (F₂-structure recovery, IR doc §11). **But the meta-strategy is identical** — "recover the algebraic substrate, use
  exact algebra instead of WL" — so the two pre-processors share the Layer-D architecture (§6).
- **Char-2 / Suzuki:** a separate analytic track (Arf/additive-trace, no `χ`); the *combinatorial* engine (F1/F3/F5)
  transfers char-agnostically, only `RecoverForm`/`Separates` change.
- **Dead ends (do not re-walk):** the WL/`bᵢ=1` build via `ColorRefinesGramK` (circular, node-4 wall, recovery doc
  §9.8.9); the frame-locked similitude predicates (idx 1221-1226, §4). δ′ dominator-closure is walled for `bᵢ=1`
  (dimensional wall, `ScratchDominatorForms`).

*Maintenance: update STATUS as F1–F5 / A1–A4 land; keep the exact-name table (§4) in sync with source line numbers
(they drift — verify before citing); this doc is the Route-C staging point, the recovery doc §9.8.9 is the reason it exists.*
