# START HERE — chain-descent graph canonizer

The single entry point for the project. Read this first; it gives the idea, the
current state, and a curated reading order. It replaces the old "simplified
overview" as the onramp (that file is now archived).

## 1. The idea, in one read

**Goal.** A polynomial-time **graph canonizer**: relabel a graph's vertices so
that two graphs get the same labelled adjacency matrix exactly when they are
isomorphic. The textbook recipe — take the lexicographically smallest adjacency
matrix over all `n!` labellings — is isomorphism-invariant for free but too slow.
The whole project is about computing that lex-min **without** enumerating `n!`.

**Search space (individualization–refinement).** *Color refinement* (1-WL)
recolours each vertex by the multiset of its neighbours' colours until colours
stabilise; vertices sharing a final colour form a **cell**. Refinement is cheap,
deterministic, iso-invariant, and never wrong — but *incomplete*: it can leave
vertices in one cell that the graph treats differently. When a cell has ≥ 2
vertices, **individualize** one (pin it as smallest) and refine again; the new
information propagates. Every choice is a branch, so this builds the
**IR tree**, whose leaves are full labellings. Naive IR (nauty) is provably
**exponential** on CFI graphs.

**The one idea — true vs. false symmetry.** At a branch cell there are two cases,
and *refinement cannot tell them apart*:
- **True symmetry** — an actual automorphism carries one vertex to another. The
  branches are mirror images: pick any one representative, descend, ignore the
  rest.
- **False symmetry (a genuine decision)** — no automorphism relates them, so the
  choices give different canonicals and must be compared.

A true symmetry can even be **hidden** (CFI "gauge twists" look like genuine
decisions but are not). Exponential blow-up *is* genuine decisions stacking up.
The entire algorithm is organized around cheaply telling a (possibly hidden) true
symmetry from a genuine decision.

**Chain descent.** Descend the IR tree, but at each cell, *before* branching, sort
its vertices into **orbits** (maximal interchangeable groups) and branch on **one
representative per orbit**. One orbit ⇒ no branching, just descend; `k` orbits ⇒
a `k`-way fork, canonize each, take the lex-min. The component that returns a
cell's orbit partition is the **oracle**, and it obeys one rule:

> **Soundness.** Never merge two vertices into one orbit without a *proof* — an
> actual automorphism, verified edge-by-edge, mapping one to the other.

Over-splitting only costs an extra branch (slower, still correct); over-merging
could drop the branch holding the true minimum. So the oracle may be cautious,
never over-confident. It does **bounded** work: when it cannot certify cheaply,
the descent **flags and stops** — it never falls back to brute force. A returned
answer always means "computed cheaply"; a flag means "needs a tool this oracle
lacks." A **polynomial node budget** makes "polynomial-or-flag" a hard guarantee.

**Why polynomial when it works.** Cost is a **sum over descent-tree nodes** of the
oracle's per-node work, and the budget bounds the node count — versus the old
design's *product* (a fully-explored tree). Replacing the product with a sum is
the entire point. Three standard facts keep the rest free: the automorphism group
stores as generators not elements (**T-A**), a base has ≤ `n` levels (**T-B**),
and — the only open factor — work-per-node is polynomial (**T-C**, *the* oracle
problem).

**Worked example — `C₆` (6-cycle `0–1–2–3–4–5–0`).** Refine: one cell `{0..5}`.
Oracle: one orbit? Yes — rotations are verified automorphisms; pick `0`, record
the 6 rotations, descend. Refine with `0` pinned: `{0},{1,5},{2,4},{3}`. Target
`{1,5}`: the reflection through `0` swaps them — one orbit; pick `1`, descend.
Refine: all singletons — **leaf**. The descent was a *single path*, two certified
levels, no genuine decision; the chain gives `|Aut(C₆)| = 6 × 2 = 12`. A *rigid*
graph instead forks honestly (each leaf reached fast, forks don't stack, budget
holds). A graph that piles genuine decisions deep (CFI over a large base)
exhausts the budget and **flags** — no wrong answer, no exponential run.

**What is settled vs. open.** Settled: the algorithm is **correct** (returns an
iso-invariant, complete canonical form or an honest flag — never wrong) and
**budget-bounded** (cannot run exponentially). Open: whether the oracle certifies
orbits cheaply enough that the graphs we *want* canonized fit the budget rather
than flagging — in full generality this *is* **GI ∈ P**, still open.

**Isolation is the method, not a surrender — read this before concluding any piece
is hopeless.** The project's recurring move is to wall an apparently-GI-hard step
into a single named component, which makes *everything around it* unconditional, and
*then* to attack that component. Time and again the apparent hardness has turned out
to be an artifact of lumping together cases that are in fact handled separately, and
it dissolves once those cases are carved off — so "isolate, don't close" describes
**where a piece currently sits, never a verdict that it cannot be closed.** The
remaining hardness has been narrowed, by exactly this carving, down to one residual
wall (the hidden-Johnson / Cameron case), which is why the seal's last leg is the
explicit *"or Cameron"* escape. Closing the isolated core is the live target. (Why
the core is *not* GI ∈ P despite first appearances — the carve-out, and the angle to
close it — is set out in
[`chain-descent-general-cc-separability.md`](./chain-descent-general-cc-separability.md) §1A.)

**The architecture pivot — "de-classing."** Orbit recovery and oracle firing were
being proved *class by class* (CFI odd-degree, then even; schemes rank 2, 3, 4…).
There are unboundedly many classes, so that ladder never converges. The current
approach ([`chain-descent-declassing.md`](./chain-descent-declassing.md)) proves
recovery **non-class-specifically** behind a generic **saturation engine**, with
per-class results demoted to **witnesses** of abstract predicates. One theorem
(`theorem_2_HOR_of_pPolynomial`) now covers the entire **metric / distance-regular
family** (cycles, Johnson, Hamming, all DRGs). The two oracles (cascade + linear)
are **folded into one** recovery-based harvest; their old distinction is now a
*depth* distinction.

**Built and axiom-clean** (see the docs' STATUS blocks for specifics):
- the canonizer-correctness substrate — direction-invariance (`warm_6_2`) and the
  descent **spine** (`spine_branch_independent`) (top-level `ChainDescent.lean`);
- the **saturation engine** and the de-classed scheme family (`Saturation.lean`,
  `Scheme.lean`);
- the **unified oracle** — `matchOracle` / `matchOracleSeq`: soundness
  unconditional, completeness reduced to a single **depth witness**
  (`CascadeOracle.lean`, `Cascade.lean`);
- **Part A** — the cross-branch stabilizer-chain object (`StabilizerAt` as a
  Mathlib `Subgroup`) with both harvest seams: **soundness** and **completeness**
  (`closure gens = StabilizerAt` under a coverage witness), plus the full
  `order = ∏ basic-orbit sizes` (`Cascade.lean`, "Part A");
- the **de-classed coverage** — `coversOrbits_of_realizers` (general, non-abelian:
  the coverage witness from per-level **path-fixing realizers**, *no* group-structure
  hypothesis — abelian *or* schemes/Cameron) with `coversOrbits_of_residualInvolutive`
  as its exponent-2 corollary (the entire `Z₂^d`-residual class in one theorem,
  sidestepping the `Aut(CFI) ≅ Z₂^β ⋊ Aut(H)` structure theorem) (`Cascade.lean`);
- the **CFI cross-branch harvest** (CFI-cov.1–4) — gauge flips → the residual
  vocabulary, the cycle-space `Z₂^β`, the gauge-flip group homomorphism, and the
  full discharge in the **base-resolved regime**: `cfi_residualInvolutive` (Lemma A
  + Lemma B: a residual fixing a gadget-separating `P` is exponent-2) ⇒
  `closure {involutive residual auts} = StabilizerAt S` and `|Aut_S^P| = ∏
  basic-orbit sizes` (`cfi_closure_eq_stabilizerAt_of_pSeparates` /
  `cfi_card_stabilizerAt_of_pSeparates`, `Cascade.lean` / `CFI.lean`).

**The conservation finding that set the current direction.** The within-cell
discretizing oracle was *proven unable* to harvest a multi-step moved orbit
(`lockstep_disc_imp_stab_trivial`). So multi-step hidden symmetry (CFI gauge
twists, `tw ≥ 2`) **must** be harvested **cross-branch** — which is why Part A (a
group object to fold automorphisms into) exists.

**The mechanism (cross-branch harvest).** `coversOrbits_of_realizers` reproduces
*any* residual group — abelian or non-abelian — from the refinement-computable
harvest, with the CFI exponent-2 case a corollary (CFI-cov.4 complete in the
base-resolved regime; C# canonizes CFI(K₄–K₇)). The general polynomiality capstone
`crossBranchHarvest_reproduces_residual` / `autP_reproduced_of_visibleRealizers`
(`Cascade.lean` Part A) reproduces the residual **group and order**, modulo a single
recovery witness. **Localisation** — the gap to full polynomiality — is the
*polynomiality* layer: coverage correctness is unconditional; recovery makes the
harvest refinement-computable (`recoverableByDepth_pPolynomial` exports the metric/DRG
family); per-level recovery is the substrate-conditional WL-dimension discriminator.

**The goal is one theorem — "reaches a rigid or Cameron residual" — now a conditional
seal `modulo {G3 + G2-B}`.** The abstract capstone `reachesRigidOrCameron`
(`Cascade.lean`) wires the trichotomy `¬IsPrimitive ∨ ¬NonCascade ∨ Cameron`; every
rank-≥3 schurian residual is `ReachesRigid ∨ IsCameronScheme`. Landed axiom-clean: leg B
(`AbelianConsumed`, citation-free), depth-graded recovery (G1a), the imprimitive block
leg (G2-A, *earned* `SchemeBlockRecovered`), and the primitivity bridge
`isPreprimitive_iff_isPrimitive`. The **largeness** antecedent is now carried honestly
(`LargenessBridge` identity); the earlier vacuous *no-fusion* "derivation" was excised
(2026-06-07). The "or Cameron" half is **Cameron-hard, not GI-hard** — *whether* a
non-abelian obstruction arises is ≡ **GI ∈ P** (out of scope); *classifying* one as a
Cameron section is the in-scope, finite target. The adversarial fusion battery ran all
three tiers: **no genuine fusion is constructible** — it splits into a separable case
(Tier-0-handled) and a non-decomposable case that is empirically a genuine Cameron
section (no third species). The unconditional block-visibility route to primitivity was
refuted (Shrikhande, depth-graded).

**The single open proposition — G2-B** (2026-06-10, axiom-clean, build green): a
*primitive, small, non-abelian, non-recovering* residual, plus the cited
`PrimitiveCCClassification` (G3, Babai/Sun–Wilmes, solid rank 3/4). Both empirical
falsifiers — the Hanaki–Miyamoto catalogue and the affine `ΓL(1,2^d)` sweep — returned
**0 G2-B witnesses** (empirically strong, uncited). The **2026-06-10 rewiring** sharpened
what G2-B requires: a step-back (recovery depth is `O(log n)`, not `O(1)`, with the
growth living entirely in the *handled* legs while the G2-B residue stays flat, depth ≤ 4)
showed the old recovery predicate over-required — it folded the unbounded **IR-core**
(the multipede term) into the seal. The conservation split
`recovery_depth = base(G) + s(C)(G) + IR_core(G)` (`stablyRecoverable_iff_symmetric_and_bases`)
+ `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaSymmetricRecovery` (keyed on the IR-core-free
`SchemeRecoveredWhileSymmetric`, root group reproduced from the symmetry phase *alone*)
move the IR-core to the **second guarantee** (flag-allowed). The seal's open content is
now the bounded, empirically-`O(1)` **`s(C)` term** (`SelfDetectsWhileSymmetric`) —
strictly weaker than the old obligation. Full chronology and every gap:

**What NOT to do (a proven boundary, 2026-06-10).** Do not attack G2-B by exhibiting it as a **block / scheme
congruence**: `intraCellRelations_eq_singleton_zero_of_primitive` proves the intra-cell block route *identically
vanishes on the primitive floor* (a primitive scheme forces it to `{0}`), so it discharges **only** the imprimitive
case (already handled by `hImprim`). The genuine G2-B is a *non-congruence amorphic WL-fusion* (the Clebsch `S₃`)
that no closed-subset object captures; the live route is the **forward / counting** crux (a base-homogeneous
separability gap broken at base+O(1) extra individualizations), not a block construction. **Note — caveats the
handoff sharpens** ([`chain-descent-seal-handoff.md`](./chain-descent-seal-handoff.md), the authoritative state):
(1) the largeness bridge is **carried, not derived** (the old vacuous "derivation" was excised, §2–§3 there); (2)
**no re-keying of the rigid predicate closes the seal** (§4.0 there) — closure ⟺ G2-B empty.

## 3. Reading order

Read in this sequence; each doc has a STATUS block (its current state) at the top.

**Core (read in full, in order):**
1. **This doc** — the idea + current state.
2. [`chain-descent-strategy.md`](./chain-descent-strategy.md) — the algorithm as a
   whole and the correctness/polynomiality requirements; the propagation substrate.
3. [`chain-descent-calculator.md`](./chain-descent-calculator.md) — the **oracle**
   (the hardest component): the stabilizer-chain model, the hardness map, the
   T-A/T-B/T-C decomposition. *Its §5–§7 describe the pre-declassing two-oracle
   design and are explicitly legacy — read them for the soundness story, not for
   how the oracle now fires.*
4. [`chain-descent-declassing.md`](./chain-descent-declassing.md) — **the current
   architecture**: de-classed recovery + the unified oracle. This supersedes the
   two-oracle / order-model framing in docs 2–3 where they differ. Its §9 is the
   live frontier.
5. [`chain-descent-schreier-sims.md`](./chain-descent-schreier-sims.md) — **Part A**,
   the cross-branch stabilizer-chain object and the current work thread.
6. [`PublicTheoremIndex.md`](../GraphCanonizationProofs/PublicTheoremIndex.md) —
   the theorem index; densest file, the ground truth for *what is proved*. Read in
   full. **It is well over 1000 lines — too large for one `Read` call (and even
   300-line pages can exceed the token cap, the rows are dense). Page through it
   with `Read` `offset`/`limit` in ~150-line chunks. Do NOT substitute a `grep`
   during onboarding: a prior summary or this onboarding's prose is exactly the lossy
   compression this file is the ground truth for — confirming a few names with
   `grep` is not reading it, and the gap is invisible unless you read it.**

**Side reading, pulled in as the core docs point to it** (each is a deep-dive or
witness layer, not onboarding):
- cascade oracle → [`chain-descent-cascade-oracle.md`](./chain-descent-cascade-oracle.md)
- linear oracle → [`chain-descent-linear-oracle.md`](./chain-descent-linear-oracle.md)
- orbit-recovery witness theorems → [`chain-descent-orbit-recovery.md`](./chain-descent-orbit-recovery.md)
  (the two load-bearing per-class witnesses, Theorem 1 + Theorem 2; the long
  historical narrative is archived)
- deferred decisions → [`chain-descent-deferred-decisions.md`](./chain-descent-deferred-decisions.md)
- harvest-window lemma → [`chain-descent-harvest-window.md`](./chain-descent-harvest-window.md)
- the wall (hidden Johnson) → [`chain-descent-hidden-johnson.md`](./chain-descent-hidden-johnson.md)
- oracle-capability seal + **the Exhaustive-Obstruction Lemma (the current forward thread, 2026-06-05)** →
  [`chain-descent-exhaustive-obstruction.md`](./chain-descent-exhaustive-obstruction.md) — the "or Cameron"
  half of the goal; Approach 3 (Cameron-free scheme leg) active — scheme primitivity, the imprimitive ⟹
  refinement-visible bridge, and the group-side `isPreprimitive_iff_isPrimitive` bridge landed; the
  refinement-side decomposition deferred (substrate-conditional), capstone cited
- **THE SEAL HANDOFF — current state + all the gaps to "consumed-or-Cameron" (THE CURRENT HANDOFF, 2026-06-07)** →
  [`chain-descent-seal-handoff.md`](./chain-descent-seal-handoff.md) — the authoritative handoff. Records the seal's
  state after the **vacuity correction** (the old `∃ gens, closure = SchemeAutGroup` rigid predicate was trivially
  true; replaced by the visible-realizer `SchemeRecovered`), and the four gaps: G1a depth-graded recovery, **G1b
  leg B (abelian) missing — the most actionable**, G2 the leaks (open `s(C)` frontier), G3 the citation. Start here
  for *any* gap. **Subsumes** the Route B handoff below.
- **Route B — the imprimitive branch (SUPERSEDED by the seal handoff; read for the G2-A blow-by-blow only)** →
  [`chain-descent-routeB-handoff.md`](./Archive/ChainDescent/chain-descent-routeB-handoff.md) (archived) — its capstones were found vacuous (see its
  top correction note); the genuine, kept pieces (`hfiber_of_fiberVisibleRealizers`, the conditional chain) are
  catalogued in the seal handoff §4 G2-A / §5.

**Paper-stage / planning docs** (theoretical targets, not yet formalized — read
only if working that thread): `chain-descent-tier3-decomposability.md`,
`chain-descent-tier3-tractable-buildout.md` (its Part A landed → schreier-sims;
Part B is the open roadmap), `chain-descent-tier3a-cascade-composition.md`
(+ `-tier3a-b1-build-plan.md`),
`chain-descent-extended-twist-viability.md`,
`chain-descent-abelian-sufficiency-handoff.md`,
`chain-descent-cfi-gauge-discharge-plan.md` (the CFI-cov.4 gauge-nut build plan; CFI harvest landed; the
base-resolved hypothesis re-wired 2026-06-06 from the vacuous `PSeparatesGadgets` onto the colour-model
`CellSeparatesGadgets`, carried as a witness — the orthogonal visible/cascade leg),
`chain-descent-fusion-battery-plan.md` (the no-fusion battery + the route to *deriving* leg C's largeness).

**Temporary handoffs** (consumed — retained only for build conventions + Lean gotchas, not the work thread):
`chain-descent-partA-handoff.md`. **Its §4 "next target" is obsolete** (that thread — de-classing →
CFI-cov.4 — is done; see [`chain-descent-schreier-sims.md`](./chain-descent-schreier-sims.md) §7). Read it
only for §1 (build/verify/doc-sync conventions) and §2 (Lean gotchas).

**Archived (consumed / superseded / historical — moved to [`Archive/ChainDescent/`](./Archive/ChainDescent/), not in the live `docs/` listing):**
`chain-descent-a2iii-plan.md` (A2-iii resolved negatively — Shrikhande refutes unconditional block-visibility),
`chain-descent-routeB-handoff.md` (superseded by the seal handoff; G2-A blow-by-blow only),
`chain-descent-tier2-lean-plan.md` (goal achieved — the Tier-2 axioms it set out to discharge are landed).

## 4. The code

Two sides, both under the repo root. Build commands are in [`../README.md`](../README.md).

**C# — the experiment bed** (`GraphCanonizationProject/`). Strategies are tried
here first. `ChainDescent.cs` + `CanonGraphOrdererChainDescent.cs` are the
canonizer; the oracle sits behind the `ITransversalOracle` seam. Tested in
`GraphCanonizationProject.Tests/` (an isomorphism-stability bed + the CFI hard
cases). C# already canonizes CFI(K₄–K₇).

**Lean — the proofs** (`GraphCanonizationProofs/`). The active library is the
**`ChainDescent/` module split**; the top-level `ChainDescent.lean` holds the
direction-invariance and spine invariants that everything imports.

| Module | Proves |
|---|---|
| `ChainDescent.lean` (top level) | direction-invariance `warm_6_2`, the descent **spine** |
| `ChainDescent/Saturation.lean` | the generic saturation engine (`exists_iterate_isFixed_within`) |
| `ChainDescent/Scheme.lean` | the de-classed metric/DRG family (`theorem_2_HOR_of_pPolynomial`) |
| `ChainDescent/Cascade.lean` | Leg A recovery; **Part A** stabilizer-chain object; the seal capstones + leg B + block/depth-graded recovery + §13a single-base recovery |
| `ChainDescent/CascadeAffine.lean` | the depth-`k` scheme-separation engine (§13b/§13c) + the Phase-2 affine beachhead (`affineScheme`, Frobenius, the cyclotomic `s(C)` machinery + the conditional affine-family seal capstones) + the **§S-bridge/§S-gate/§S-gate2** seal wiring of the separability theory (the PV-Thm-3.1 warmRefine bridge B1–B5; the general-CC pointed transport + the citation checkpoint `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaExtensionSeparability`) — split out of `Cascade.lean` (leaf; carries the finite-field imports) |
| `ChainDescent/ClebschConcrete.lean` | the **concrete ℤ₄² amorphic-NLS Clebsch scheme** (hard-coded `AssociationScheme 16` from its colour matrix, axioms by `decide`) + **the first non-affine δ′ closure in Lean** (`clebschZ4_closure` / `clebschZ4_discrete`: `b(X) ≤ 2`, the seal's `hclo` discharged for a real non-affine primitive G2-B residue; axiom-clean, no `native_decide`) |
| `ChainDescent/Separability.lean` | the homogeneous separability substrate: the PV-Thm-3.1 `c=1` forced-triangle calculus (§S.1–§S.16: valencies, indistinguishing number, `saAdj`/`transport`, the sparse theorem's counting lemmas) + the §S.17 `AlgIso`/`Separable` layer |
| `ChainDescent/CoherentConfig.lean` | the **general (multi-fiber) coherent-configuration substrate** (the live build's Stage 0–2): the `CoherentConfig` type, general `AlgIso`/`Separable`/`SeparablePointed`, the Thm-4.1 predicates + cited `Theorem41Statement`, the **constructed point extension** (§CC.8) and the pointed transport core (§CC.9) |
| `ChainDescent/CascadeOracle.lean` | the unified `matchOracle` / `matchOracleSeq` |
| `ChainDescent/LinearOracle.lean` | the linear (abelian/CFI) oracle |
| `ChainDescent/CFI.lean` | CFI gadgets, gauge flips, the `Z₂^β` cycle space, CFI-cov |
| `ChainDescent/Group.lean` | permutation-group scaffolding |
