## STATUS (read first)

**The framework is landed and axiom-clean; the pilot is the live frontier.**
[`ChainDescent/ScratchCostModel.lean`](../GraphCanonizationProofs/ChainDescent/ScratchCostModel.lean)
(core-only, WIP, not in `build.sh`) builds the cost monad + the budgeted process + the ② mechanism. The
three framework theorems verify axiom-clean — in fact tighter than the project bar: `[propext, Quot.sound]`,
**no `Classical.choice`**. Landed decls: `CostM` (+ `bind`/`tick`/`cost` lemmas), `budgetedIterate`,
`cost_budgetedIterate_le` (the ② heart), `done_of_budgetedIterate_some`, `BudgetedCanonizer` +
`cost_run_le`.

**What building it settled.** ② (`canon_poly_or_flag`) is **unconditional by construction** — `cost ≤ budget`
holds with *no* hypothesis (the `∨ flag` disjunct is not even needed for the cost side). So **all**
poly-completeness content lives in **③-forward** (`residue_if_flag`: `handled ⟹ ¬flag`), never in ②. This
refines the endgame-spec's obligation map: **② is the unconditional *safety* guarantee (never exceeds
budget); ③-forward is the *completeness* content (handled inputs actually finish within it).**

**What's left (the pilot, gated on the Runtime-Phase descent model):** (a) the per-node cost `w` from real
primitives; (b) `canonForm?` as a `BudgetedCanonizer` instance; (c) the node-count-on-handled-inputs bound
that feeds the seal's base bound — the quasipoly pilot. §5–§6.

---

## 1. Purpose, and the relocation of "where poly lives"

The cost model discharges two `Publication.lean` obligations:
- **② `canon_poly_or_flag`** — `cost G ≤ costConst·n^costDeg ∨ canonForm? G = none`.
- **③-forward `residue_if_flag`** — `canonForm? G = none → UnhandledResidue G` (the weakened, `→`-only form:
  the `↔` was dropped because the headline never used `residue → flag`, and that backward direction is the
  prove-the-hard-case-fails direction the project struggles with).

**The design decision D3 (budget-capped) collapses ② and relocates the content.** If `canonForm?` is the
*budget-capped* descent — it flags the moment a fixed node budget is hit — then `cost ≤ budget` is true **by
construction**, unconditionally. This is not a weakening: the real algorithm already has a hard node budget
(the project's "cannot run exponentially" is a *settled, unconditional* guarantee). The consequence is that
the genuine research content — *handled graphs actually finish within the budget* — is not in ② at all; it
is **③-forward** (`handled ⟹ ¬flag`), and it is exactly the same content as the seal (reaches-rigid ⟹
discretizes in a bounded number of nodes). **This is where "poly stops being a meta-argument."**

Reading, in one line: **② says "never over budget" (free); ③-forward says "the budget is generous enough
that handled inputs finish" (the work).**

## 2. The seven decisions (locked), each with its realization

| # | Decision | Resolution | Realized by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Model of computation / granularity | **Cost monad** — cost carried *with* the value, tied to the code; not a parallel bookkeeping function. Declared unit-cost primitives (D7) are the residual meta-surface. | `CostM`, `bind`, `tick`, `cost` |
| **D2** | Cost decomposition | **`cost = node_count × per_node`** — localizes the hard content (`node_count` ← seal/branching) away from the easy (`per_node` ← concrete poly). | `budgetedIterate` (fuel=nodes, `w`=per-node); `BudgetedCanonizer.nbud`/`w` |
| **D3** | Budget-capped vs uncapped | **Budget-capped** ⟹ ② unconditional, content relocated to ③-forward (§1). Matches the real hard-budget algorithm. | `cost_budgetedIterate_le`, `BudgetedCanonizer.cost_run_le` |
| **D4** | Node-accounting model | The descent is a **node-sequential traversal**: `σ` carries the branch frontier/stack + best-so-far, `step` processes one node, `fuel` = total node budget. Branching lives *inside* `σ`, so the linear iterate counts the whole tree. | `budgetedIterate` + the §3 `σ` framing |
| **D5** | Bound form | **Explicit `C·n^k`** (not `∃ p : Polynomial`): honest, avoids formalizing the class P, reviewer reads the degree. Degree TBD from `w`·`nbud`. | `BudgetedCanonizer.nbud`/`w`; `Publication.costConst`/`costDeg` |
| **D6** | Input size measure | **Vertex count `n`** (poly in `n` ⟺ poly in bit-size `n²`). | `nbud n`, `w n` |
| **D7** | Declared unit-cost primitives | An **explicit list** of what counts as one tick (e.g. an `F_q` op, one `warmRefine` signature compare). Proven poly-size where cheap; declared where formalizing bit-cost is disproportionate. The new, small "meta" footprint. | §4 + §8 |

**Optional later (noted, no planning needed):** D3's cap may get a *disableable* flag for downstream
convenience — a runtime knob, not part of the showcase. It does not change any statement above.

## 3. The framework as built, and the D4 traversal-state framing

```
CostM α            := α × Nat                        -- value with its tick count (D1)
budgetedIterate step done fuel s : CostM (Option σ)  -- run ≤ fuel steps; some = leaf, none = FLAG
cost_budgetedIterate_le : (∀ s, cost (step s) ≤ w) → cost (budgetedIterate … fuel s) ≤ fuel · w
done_of_budgetedIterate_some : (budgetedIterate … s).1 = some s' → done s'
BudgetedCanonizer σ := { step, done, nbud, w, hstep }   -- packages the explicit budget nbud·w
BudgetedCanonizer.cost_run_le : cost (run M n s₀) ≤ nbud n · w n     -- ② for free, unconditional
```

**The key modeling choice (D4).** The descent *branches* (k-way at a cell with k orbits), and the poly
target is the leaf count `∏ bᵢ`, not the depth. Yet the framework's `budgetedIterate` is a *linear* loop.
These reconcile by choosing the state `σ` to be the **traversal configuration**: the current branch frontier
(a stack of pending subproblems) plus the best-so-far canonical candidate. Then:
- `step s` = "process the next descent node" (refine + oracle at that node, push/pop the frontier);
- `fuel` = the **total node budget** (not depth);
- `done s` = "frontier empty, lex-min settled";
- `cost ≤ fuel · w` = **(total nodes) × (per-node work)** — exactly the D2 decomposition, counting the whole
  branching tree, with the branching hidden inside `σ`.

This is why the linear iterate suffices: no tree-shaped recursion is needed, and the node budget bounds the
tree size directly. Defining this concrete `σ` (and `canonForm?` as its `BudgetedCanonizer`) is the
first Runtime-Phase build.

---

## 4. Per-node cost `w` (D2 easy half; D7)

`w n` bounds the work at a single descent node. Its constituents, each concretely polynomial in `n`:
- **`warmRefine`** — 1-WL refinement: `n` rounds, each a pass over `Fin n × Fin n` with a signature sort.
  Concretely `O(n² · …)`; **buildable now** against the real `ChainDescent.warmRefine` (this is the natural
  next brick after the framework — it also exercises the seal-side import path early).
- **The oracle** — orbit certification at the node: group ops / Gaussian elimination (rigid) / form recovery
  (Route C), all poly-size `F_q` arithmetic.
- **Selection** — the partition-invariant target-cell selector; a pass over cells.

**The R1 / Aut-free connection (important).** `w` must count the oracle's *actual* work. If the oracle
computes `Aut` (as the de-risking F1 path does, consuming `O_p(Aut)`), that computation's cost enters `w` —
and its poly-ness is the meta-circularity concern of route-c-plan §7a. The **Aut-free geometric
coordinatizer (R1)** is precisely what keeps `w` poly for the affine-polar pilot without a circular
`Aut`-computation. So R1 is not only a Seal-Phase cleanliness item — it is a *prerequisite for a poly `w`* on
the pilot family. Any node whose honest `w` cannot be shown poly forces that family into `UnhandledResidue`
(§7).

The D7 list = the leaf primitives these decompose to (one `F_q` op, one signature compare, …), each either a
proven poly-size lemma or an explicitly declared unit cost.

---

## 5. The consumption bridge — node count ≤ `nbud` (D2 hard half; ③-forward)

The one non-free ingredient: **the node count on handled inputs is ≤ `nbud n`.** This is where the seal is
consumed and "poly stops being meta." Decomposition:

```
total nodes  ≤  (leaf count) × (max depth)
leaf count   ≤  ∏ᵢ bᵢ            -- bᵢ = #orbits in the selected cell at level i  (recovery-route)
max depth    ≤  |T|              -- the individualization base size (the seal's base bound)
```

- **Depth** `|T|` is bounded by the seal's base bound — for affine-polar, `reachesRigidOrCameron_affinePolar`
  carries `T.card ≤ 128·(Nat.log 2 ((p^d)²)+1) = O(d log p)`.
- **Branching** `bᵢ` is bounded per level — `bᵢ ≤ q²` for span-dim-1 (recovery-route `ScratchSpanDimBound`),
  with the crude a-priori `#orbits ≤ |K|^{|S|+1}` as a fallback.

**Quasipoly (pilot, achievable now):** `∏ bᵢ ≤ q^{O(d log p)}` and depth `O(d log p)` ⟹ node count
quasipoly ⟹ `nbud n = n^{O(log n)}` suffices ⟹ handled affine-polar residues return `some` (no flag).
**Poly (later):** identical shape once the open `∏ bᵢ ≤ poly` branching bound lands (recovery-route T0). **The
framework, the pilot mechanics, and the bridge are all reused verbatim; only the branching bound sharpens.**

This is the strategic payoff (§ STATUS): the cost-model *framework* is decoupled from the open research —
buildable and pilotable now on the closed quasipoly seal, with the poly result dropping in later.

---

## 6. The pilot — affine-polar, quasipoly

**Target.** Instantiate `BudgetedCanonizer` on the affine-polar `VO^ε` residue and prove:
1. **per-node** `w n ≤ n^c` (§4) — from `warmRefine` + the (Aut-free, §4) oracle;
2. **node budget met** `handled G → ∃ s', (run M n s₀).1 = some s'` (§5) — the descent discretizes within
   `nbud n = n^{O(log)}`, from the seal's base bound + the span-dim-1 branching bound;
3. compose with `cost_run_le` (② free) and correctness (①) ⟹ the affine-polar residue is canonized within a
   **proven quasipoly cost**, in the Lean cost model.

**What it exercises:** every framework piece except the poly-specific branching bound; the seal→runtime
consumption; the D4 traversal `σ`; the D7 `w`. It is the first end-to-end structural-bound → runtime-cost
proof in the project, and the template the poly case reuses. **Note honestly:** it proves *quasipoly*, not
poly — the mechanism is validated, the degree is not yet polynomial.

**Dependencies:** the Runtime-Phase descent model (`canonForm?` as a `BudgetedCanonizer`), which is the
gating build; and (for a poly `w`) R1.

---

## 7. The coupling: budget level ↔ what's provably poly ↔ `UnhandledResidue`

③-forward (`handled ⟹ ¬flag`) requires the budget `nbud·w` to be ≥ the *true* node count on handled graphs.
So the budget's degree is **exactly the best provable node bound across all handled families**, and anything
worse gets flagged — hence must sit inside `UnhandledResidue` for ③ to hold. Concretely:
- A family with a proven poly node bound → inside the budget → handled.
- A family only provably *quasipoly* (or only meta) → either the headline degrades to "quasipoly-or-flag" for
  it, **or** it moves into `UnhandledResidue`.

This is the exact mechanism by which the firewall bites: a *meta*-poly family (Route C today) either becomes
a real `cost ≤ poly` proof (via this cost model) or goes into the excluded residue. It cannot be axiomatized.
The cost model is thus the instrument that decides, per family, "handled at poly" vs "excluded."

---

## 8. The residual meta-surface — what "poly" means after this

Today the project disclaims: "poly is a meta-claim; no runtime model." After the cost model, that blanket
disclaimer is replaced by a **small, explicit** one: "poly *in the declared cost model*", whose only
non-Lean content is the **D7 unit-cost primitive list** (the handful of primitives declared unit-cost rather
than bit-cost-formalized). The paper states that list. This is a large honesty upgrade — from "no runtime
model" to "a Lean runtime model with an explicit, inspectable primitive-cost declaration."

---

## 9. Build notes, risks, open items

**Build notes.**
- The framework is **core-only** (no Mathlib): `import Mathlib` is pathologically slow in this env (timed out
  past 8 min), and the framework needs only `Nat`/`Option`/`Prod` + `omega`. Keeping the reusable core
  Mathlib-free is a bonus — it stays fast. **The pilot is heavy**: instantiating on the real affine-polar
  residue pulls in the seal (hence Mathlib), so expect slow compiles there.
- Verify: `cd GraphCanonizationProofs && lake build ChainDescent.ScratchCostModel` then a `#print axioms`
  check file — expect `[propext, Quot.sound]` for the framework theorems.

**Risks / open items.**
- **The D4 descent-model extension is the biggest new build** — defining `canonForm?` as a `BudgetedCanonizer`
  over the branching traversal `σ`. It is Runtime-Phase and gates the pilot's steps 2–3.
- **The pilot's branching bound must be confirmed sufficient** — span-dim-1 `bᵢ ≤ q²` + the a-priori bound
  must compose to a quasipoly node count; confirm the general (span-dim ≥ 2) affine-polar case is covered by
  the seal's discreteness, not left open.
- **D7's declared primitives are a judgement call** a reviewer may push on — keep the list minimal and
  proven-where-cheap.
- **`w` poly-ness depends on R1** for the pilot family (§4) — the Aut-free coordinatizer is on the critical
  path for a poly (not just quasipoly-with-Aut-harvest) `w`.
