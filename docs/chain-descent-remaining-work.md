## ⭐ SEAL-PHASE WRAP-UP CHECKLIST (2026-07-09) — the CURRENT authoritative "what's left for the Seal Phase"

> Everything BELOW this section is organized around the older WL-dimension route. THIS section is the current
> **Algorithm-A / confinement / "two seals"** framing and supersedes the older "what's left" prose for the headline.
> **Seal Phase = the symmetric-domain seal = Algorithm A (confinement) = the ① correctness proof for the non-rigid
> residue.** ① (`canon_sound` + `canon_complete`) is **DONE and axiom-clean (sorry-free)** for the index-free descent
> canonizer `descentCanon` (`ScratchConfinementX3Complete.lean`; `descentCanon_showcase` = sound ∧ complete), modulo the
> confinement citation bundle `ConfinementCitations`. The whole W-plan (W1–W4) that closed ①b→ is done. What remains to
> make the Seal Phase **unconditional / portable**:

**1. hImprim / primitivity — SILENT `hprim` REMOVED, WALL-FREE + AXIOM-CLEAN (2026-07-09; NOT the wall).**
**★★★ LANDED (`ScratchConfinementCellImprim.lean`, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, additive,
NOT in build.sh):** the confinement is now **total in primitivity** — the silent `hprim` is gone. Capstone
`confinement_selectedCellIsOrbit_spine_cell_total` composes Piece 1's proved dichotomy (`¬IsPrimitive ∨ Cameron`)
with the wall-free `FrameSelectorTransitive → SelectedCellIsOrbit` tail, routing **each** branch to `FST`: Cameron via
`hWitt`, imprimitive via the new explicit `hImprimTrans : ¬IsPrimitive → FrameSelectorTransitive` (transitivity, NEVER
`BlockRefinementVisible`). Threaded end-to-end to the **total ① showcase** `descentCanon_showcase_cell_total` (sound ∧
complete, no silent `hprim`; bundle `ConfinementCitationsCellTotal` reads {G3, Liebeck, Witt, `hImprimTrans`, D0}).
`hImprimTrans` is a CARRIED family input with the same downstream status as `hWitt` (vacuous on the primitive rank-3
forms families; per-family/generic discharge is downstream, off the critical path, never the wall). Confinement carried
`hprim : IsPrimitive`. **★★ KEY VERIFICATION (2026-07-09): discharging it does NOT require the wall.** The soundness need
is `SelectedCellIsOrbit` = "the selected cell is ONE `R`-orbit (vertex-transitive)". **Imprimitive is STILL VT** (transitive
*with* a finer invariant partition INSIDE the orbit — blocks do NOT split the orbit into several orbits; confirmed:
`schemeBlock_fiber_transitive`/`schemeBlocks_transitive` both open with `haveI := schemeAutGroup_isPretransitive S`, i.e.
they describe block structure INSIDE an already-transitive scheme). So an imprimitive residue SATISFIES `SelectedCellIsOrbit`
and assume-VT-pruning it is SOUND — imprimitivity is **not a soundness concern at all**. `hprim` is a *certification* fact
(it routes VT-certification through G3 → Cameron → Witt), not a soundness requirement.
  - **★ PRIMARY discharge (generic, wall-free): block-tower transitivity-PRESERVATION.** A large-imprimitive residue stays
    vertex-transitive: `schemeBlocks_transitive` (quotient transitive, `Scheme.lean:3963`) + `schemeBlock_fiber_transitive`
    (fiber transitive, `Scheme.lean:3949`) — **both proved, both open with `haveI := schemeAutGroup_isPretransitive S`** ⟹
    whole scheme transitive ⟹ the cell is one orbit ⟹ `SelectedCellIsOrbit`. NO `BlockRefinementVisible`, no WL-dimension,
    no per-family case-work. This is the recommended primary route (2026-07-09 correction — see the next bullet for why the
    former "primary" is not wiring). Remaining build = a **bridge lemma** "scheme block-tower transitivity ⟹ `SelectedCellIsOrbit`",
    which shares the descent-`Aut`↔`SchemeAutGroup` identification (cell-faithfulness / `IsBase(T∪C)`) with checklist item 2 —
    so items 1 and 2 are ONE work-front here, not two.
  - **◐ SECONDARY (per-family vacuity): `G₀Irreducible ⟹ IsPrimitive` — FORWARD-M1 NOW BUILT (2026-07-09, axiom-clean).**
    `ScratchAffinePrimitive.irreducible_imp_isPrimitive_affineScheme` proves the genuine **dual** of the pre-existing
    `isPrimitive_affineScheme_imp_irreducible` (which was the *converse* `IsPrimitive → G₀Irreducible`; the doc/memory had
    mis-cited it — orientation corrected). Proof = the block-system `I` ⟹ `G₀`-invariant subspace `W = {v | orbital(v) ∈ I}`
    construction (closure = the intersection-number step of `schemeEquiv_trans` run additively), then irreducibility forces
    `W ∈ {⊥,⊤}` ⟹ `I ∈ {{0},univ}`. Completes the intended `IsPrimitive ⟺ G₀Irreducible` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2203`). This
    discharges `hImprimTrans` **vacuously** for the entire affine residue class: `G₀Irreducible` (checkable — `G0cyc_irreducible`
    `:3434`, `G0pow` field-generation) → `IsPrimitive(affineScheme G₀)` → (via the `M.S`↔`affineScheme` seam = item 2)
    `M.S.IsPrimitive` → `hImprimTrans := fun himp => absurd hprim himp`. **Remaining coupling:** the `M.S`↔`affineScheme` seam
    (item 2). So `hImprimTrans` is discharged for affine residues **modulo the seam** — no longer a carried assumption for that
    class, and the generic backstop (block-tower transitivity-preservation) covers any hypothetical non-affine imprimitive.
  - **★ DEAD ROUTE — do NOT use `cell_splits_of_imprimitive` / `BlockRefinementVisible`.** That is the SEAL's
    (`reachesRigidOrCameron` `hImprimitive`, `Cascade.lean:3278`) WL-VISIBILITY / recovery mechanism — `BlockRefinementVisible`
    is literally "the WL-dimension boundary" = `hSmallAutThin` = THE WALL. Algorithm A assume-VT-PRUNES (needs only VT, which
    the block tower PRESERVES); it never RECOVERS/splits, so it never needs visibility. **A 2026-07-09 mis-scoping routed the
    confinement's imprimitive case through this seal mechanism and thereby REINTRODUCED the wall; that routing is discarded.**
    Algorithm A stays unconditional-modulo-citations because P1 (flag ⟹ large `Aut`) excludes every small-`Aut` residue —
    the entire regime where the wall lives — from flagging. Detail = [[project_seal_phase_wrapup_2026-07-09]].

**2. SchurianScheme / `M` — a MODELLING gap, NOT an UnhandledResidue (corrected 2026-07-09).**
**★★★ PRIMITIVITY LEG BUILT (2026-07-09, axiom-clean).** The seam has three legs — (primitivity), (2-closure/`hcard` count),
(the recovery `SchemeRealizes f S (affineScheme G₀)` itself). The **primitivity leg is DONE end-to-end**:
`ScratchSchemeRealizesPrimitive.isPrimitive_of_schemeRealizes` (`IsPrimitive` transports along `SchemeRealizes`, via the
conjugation iso `S.SchemeAutGroup ≅ X.SchemeAutGroup` + `MulAction.isPreprimitive_congr` + `isPreprimitive_iff_isPrimitive`
— no `Fin (rank+1)` dependent types), composed with forward-M1 into `isPrimitive_of_realizes_affineScheme`: **recovery
`SchemeRealizes f S (affineScheme G₀)` (carried like Route C's `hreal`) + `G₀Irreducible` ⟹ `S.IsPrimitive`.** This closes
item-1's `M.S.IsPrimitive` need (hence `hImprimTrans`) for the affine class.
**★★★ LEG (b) — SKRESANOV 2-CLOSURE CITATION ELIMINATED (2026-07-09, axiom-clean).** The count bridge `hcard` was
weakened from the Skresanov **equality** `|SchemeAutGroup(M.S)| = spineResidualCard` to a **lower bound**
`hcard_le : spineResidualCard ≤ |SchemeAutGroup(M.S)|` — sound because `confinementLargeScheme` is a strict lower bound
(`2^baseMax n < |SchemeAutGroup|`) and `hcard` is consumed ONLY there. The lower bound is **provable from the FREE
direction alone** (`ScratchOrbitalSchemeAutLower.{le,card_le}_schemeAutGroup_orbitalScheme`: `G ≤ SchemeAutGroup(orbitalScheme G)`
via `orbMk_smul`) — **no `AffineSchemeTwoClosed`/`h2c`**. `cellSchemeModel_of_group` no longer takes `h2c`; the whole
cell cluster + total showcase re-verified axiom-clean. **Remaining for (b) (all PROVABLE, no citations, per the
no-carried-hypotheses discipline):** `hT` (base identification `|StabilizerAt T| = spineResidualCard`, definitional at
the spine `D_k`) + `hf : CellActionFaithful` (⟸ `IsBase(T∪C)` ⟸ `isotropic_span`, a form fact). **Remaining leg (c):**
the actual recovery witness `SchemeRealizes f S (affineScheme G₀)` (the deep, Route-C-shared form-recovery content) —
**RESOLVED as a carried CITATION (2026-07-09): leg (c) is a known-true classification fact in a known-true form, not a
project-internal claim, so it is carried in the same firewall slot as G3/Liebeck (exactly as Route C carries `hreal`),
NOT proven in-project.**
**★★★ AFFINE INSTANTIATION LANDED — THE REBUNDLE, CONCRETE (2026-07-09, `ScratchConfinementCellAffine.lean`, all
axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, NOT in build.sh).** The abstract `ConfinementCitationsCellTotal`
carries `hImprimTrans` as the honest "supplied-at-instantiation" slot; the abstract 3-item collapse is **not** cleanly
available (the redundancy is arity-dependent: `SchemeRealizes f M.S (affineScheme G₀)` only typechecks at
`cellCard C = p^d`, so it resolves only at per-family instantiation — confirming pick-up item 3). This file is the FIRST
such instantiation and makes the collapse concrete for the affine forms family:
  - `AffineRealizedResidue M G₀ hneg := ∃ (hC : cellCard C = p^d) f, SchemeRealizes f (hC ▸ M.S) (affineScheme G₀ hneg)`
    — the leg-(c) citation, concretely (Route C's `hreal` for the cell model). Arity handled by two subst-based cast
    helpers (`hne_cast`/`isPrimitive_uncast`, bound-variable casts).
  - `isPrimitive_of_affineRealizedResidue` — **`M.S.IsPrimitive` DERIVED** from the citation (forward-M1 via
    `isPrimitive_of_realizes_affineScheme` + transport); `hImprimTrans_of_affineRealizedResidue` — **`hImprimTrans`
    DERIVED** (vacuous via `hImprimTrans_of_primitive`). So both the silent `hprim` and the carried `hImprimTrans` are
    **gone — replaced by the single honest realization citation.**
  - `ConfinementCitationsCellAffine` bundle (drops the `hImprimTrans` field for global `hirr` + per-node `hRealize`) +
    `descentCanon_showcase_cell_affine` — the ① showcase (sound ∧ complete) with the collapse at the ① level,
    reusing CellImprim's `_total` adaptor. Citation base reads {G3, Liebeck, Witt, **realization-citation**, D0}.
So for the affine class the seam's imprimitive-branch obligation is now discharged by an honest external citation, not a
carried project-assumption.
**★★★ LEG (b) `hT` DISCHARGED (2026-07-09, axiom-clean, `cellSchemeModel_of_group_spine`).** `spineResidualCard adj P₀
χι₀ sel k` is *defined* as `Nat.card (StabilizerAt adj (defaultSpineChain … k).P (defaultSpineChain … k).D)`
(`ScratchConfinementP1`), so fixing the model's base to the level-`k` spine prefix (`T := (defaultSpineChain … k).D`,
`P := (defaultSpineChain … k).P`) makes `hT` **definitional** — discharged by `rfl` in the spine-specialized constructor.
`hT` drops out of the carried inputs; the constructor now takes only the family facts (`hf`/faithfulness, `hsymm`,
`hrank`) + the Witt-supplied `htrans_cell`. **Remaining for leg (b):** only `hf : CellActionFaithful` ⟸ `IsBase(T∪C)`
[`cellActionFaithful_of_isBase`, DONE] ⟸ `isotropic_span` (the form fact, form-recovery-coupled, DOWNSTREAM). **State is
now PORT-ready** modulo that one form-coupled discharge. Confinement carries
`M : ResidueSchemeModel` (a faithful schurian scheme of the residue). This is **not** a D0/`residueNonSchurian` flag:
Phase-1 **recovers** (assume-VT prune), never emits `none` (`none` is Phase-2/rigid only), and the residue it handles is
**node-4 = schurian + Cameron**. So `M` is a Lean modelling task. **Resolution (scoped 2026-07-09): the Skresanov 2-closure
citation IS usable** — `affineScheme G₀ := orbitalScheme(affineG G₀)` (`CascadeAffine.lean:2204`) is `SchurianScheme` **by
construction**, and `AffineSchemeTwoClosed` (`RouteCSeam.lean:196`) gives `SchemeAutGroup(affineScheme G₀) = affineG G₀`
(the known classical group). So resolving `M` = (a) a scheme-extraction constructor `orbitalScheme(residual group) →
ResidueSchemeModel`; (b) the 2-closure citation for `hcard` (`|SchemeAutGroup| = |StabilizerAt| = spineResidualCard`);
(c) the group-supply / faithfulness bridge (exhibit the residue's residual `Aut` — the piece the source called the
"faithfulness gap"; either recovered à la Route C, or via the pretransitive assume-VT group). **CRUCIAL COUPLING: 2-closure
needs the residue PRIMITIVE rank-3 first ⟹ depends on item 1.** Not a wall: one citation + a constructor + a bridge.
**★★ FAITHFUL CELL MODEL — BUILT + RETHREADED END-TO-END (2026-07-09, all axiom-clean, additive; old cardinality showcase
preserved).** The model lives on the SELECTED CELL `sel (χsel T) ≅ Fin (cellCard C)` (NOT the whole complement — the residual
is transitive within a colour class but not across it, `FrameSelectorTransitive`; the earlier whole-complement `{x//x∉D}`
construction in `ScratchConfinementResidual.lean` is faithful-but-intransitive SUBSTRATE, not the model). Cluster (5 files):
  - `ScratchConfinementCellModel.lean` — `CellSchemeModel` (S : `SchurianScheme (cellCard C)`, faithful) + constructor
    `cellSchemeModel_of_group`; Witt bridge `htrans_cell_of_frameSelectorTransitive` (transitivity IS supplied by Witt,
    non-vacuous); `CellInvariant` DISCHARGED (`cellInvariant_selCell_indivWarmRefine`, colour-invariance); **`CellActionFaithful`
    reduced to `IsBase`** (`cellActionFaithful_of_isBase` — `K=1 ⟺ StabilizerAt(T∪C) trivial = IsBase(T∪C)`, the descent's
    discretization predicate; forms discharge = `isotropic_span`, downstream).
  - `ScratchConfinementCellP3.lean` — `PrimRank3ClassicalCell` + `residue_primRank3ClassicalCell` + the largeness bridge +
    `confinement_selectedCellIsOrbit_spine_cell_discharged` (plugs into the generic assembly, which is abstract in the
    predicate — so the rethread is ADDITIVE); plus item-1 Piece 1 `cellResidue_imprimitive_or_cameron`.
  - `ScratchConfinementCellWitt.lean` — `confinement_selectedCellIsOrbit_spine_witt{,_classical}_cell` (Liebeck arity-poly).
  - `ScratchConfinementCellComplete.lean` — `ConfinementCitationsCell` bundle (per-node `M : ∀ H done, Σ C, CellSchemeModel`)
    + **`descentCanon_showcase_cell`** = the ① showcase (sound ∧ complete) on the FAITHFUL model, sorry-free.
  - `ScratchConfinementSchurianModel.residueModel_of_orbitalGroup` (the on-`Fin n` constructor; superseded by the cell one).
So G3 now genuinely classifies the residue CELL (`Aut(S) =` the residual cell action). **REMAINING:** (i) the forms
`IsBase(T∪C)` discharge via `isotropic_span` (couples to form-recovery, downstream); (ii) a minor cleanliness item — the
faithful `M`'s construction already presupposes `htrans_cell` (= Witt-transitivity), so `M`-existence and the carried `hWitt`
overlap (redundancy, not unsoundness; resolve at per-family instantiation). Detail = [[project_seal_phase_wrapup_2026-07-09]].

**3. Citations — audit exact Lean statements for reviewer-faithfulness.** The carried citations {G3 (`hClassify`),
Liebeck, Witt, Skresanov 2-closure (`AffineSchemeTwoClosed`)} stay cited, but each hypothesis's Lean *statement* must be
checked to match a true, correctly-scoped external theorem (no accidental over-strength / vacuity).
  - **3a. Classicality threading — DONE (2026-07-09).** §7c gap (b), the silent-correctness guard: Witt applies only to
    *classical* residues, but the old compound `hCitation : PrimRank3Classical (Cameron) → WittCellTransitive` bore the
    classicality step implicitly (a non-classical Cameron residue could be silently Witt-pruned). Split into two faithful
    citations with an explicit `IsClassicalScheme` predicate: **`hLiebeck` (Cameron ⟹ classical; largeness baked into
    `IsCameronScheme`)** + **`hWitt` (classical ⟹ cell-transitive)**. Capstone
    `ConfinementWitt.confinement_selectedCellIsOrbit_spine_witt_classical` (axiom-clean) composes them; the
    `ConfinementCitations` bundle now carries the split, so it reads {G3, Liebeck, Witt, hImprim, D0} — the true citation
    set. The old compound capstone is kept (still valid).

**4. PORT to `build.sh`.** The WIP scratch cluster (`ScratchConfinement*` + `ScratchConfinementX3{Sel,Recon,Complete}` +
the cost-model substrate) is NOT yet in `build.sh`. Mechanical.

**5. (Testbed, not Lean-Seal) C# switch to Algorithm A.** The C# runs Algorithm R + a *global* flag; aligning it to the
per-node flag / assume-VT-prune is validation, not part of the Seal correctness *proof*.

**6. ★ THE RRU PHASE-TRANSFER THEOREM — the switch-over gate to the Rigid Phase (NEW 2026-07-09, the real Phase-1
deliverable; not yet built).** Phase 1 (Algorithm A) **never emits `none`** by design: a Phase-1 flag is the *trigger*
for the assume-VT step (flagging residue is VT ⟹ the flag is *consumable* — prune the orbit, recover the symmetry, step
forward), so each flag **strictly consumes a symmetry**. Iterating drives every input to a **rigid** residue `R(G)`. The
Seal Phase's handoff object is therefore the theorem **RRU: for every input, Phase 1 terminates at a rigid, iso-invariant
residue `R(G)`** — a *proven* object (per-step = `SelectedCellIsOrbit`; iterated to a rigid fixpoint + endpoint
iso-invariance), NOT an `opaque` predicate a Phase-2 flag certifies. `R(G)` is exactly what **Phase 2 (the rigid solver)
consumes**; Phase 2 has no recovery for its own flag yet ⟹ **Phase 2 is the sole source of `none`.** Consequences for the
Publication objects: (a) ① / ② being proven against a **total, never-`none`** object is *by design* (Phase-1 totality),
NOT a vacuity — the `∨ none` disjunct is reserved for Phase 2; (b) `Publication.canonForm?`/`cost` should **unify ① and ②
onto one object** (today ①'s `descentCanonForm? := some (descentCanon)` is structurally always-`some`, while ②'s
`CanonForm.canonForm?` is a separate capped object — both total, but distinct).
**★ SCOPED + RESOLVED (2026-07-09) — the boundary is DEFERRAL / `IsBase`, NOT the flag threshold; RRU is an ASSEMBLY of
built parts.** The phase boundary is the **deferred-decisions** scheduler (`docs/chain-descent-deferred-decisions.md`): at
each cell the oracle **consumes** symmetry (a pair with `OrbitPartition adj P S v w` = a path-fixing automorphism swaps
them) or **defers** a **real decision** (`¬OrbitPartition`); soundness = **`real_stays_real`** (`CascadeOracle.lean:74`,
reals stay real under more individualization). "Oracle has nothing left to consume" = only reals remain = **rigid** =
**`IsBase`** (`spineResidualCard = 1`, `card_stabilizerAt_eq_one_iff_isBase`) = definition **(b) literally rigid**
(user-confirmed). `R(G)` = the **first `IsBase` residue** reached. **THE `[small-Aut, trivial-Aut]` GAP DISSOLVES:**
consumption is **orbit-based** (any automorphism), not size/threshold-based — `¬IsBase` always yields a consumable
`OrbitPartition` pair, so the boundary is exactly trivial-`Aut`; the **flag is a COST mechanism**, confined to the `¬IsBase`
symmetric side by **P2** (`flag_imp_symmetric_spine`, `ScratchConfinement.lean:266`), NOT the boundary. **Substrate ALL
BUILT** (rigid=`IsBase`; `real_stays_real`+`OrbitPartition.mono`; P2; consumption sound large-`Aut`=confinement
`SelectedCellIsOrbit` / small-`Aut`=`matchOracle`/`coversOrbits_of_realizers`; termination backbone
`defaultSpineChain_reaches_leaf`).
**★★★ BRICKS 1+2 LANDED (2026-07-10, `Cascade.lean`, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, IN

`forcedNode_relabel` (FULL cross-graph iso-invariance under arbitrary `σ`, not just `Aut`) + `exists_isBase_saturated`
(iterative termination). Banked as the named RRU handoff: **`rigidResidue adj := forcedNode adj (fun _ _ => .unknown) ∅`**
(the support of `Aut(G)`), with **`rigidResidue_isBase`** (rigid, unconditional) + **`rigidResidue_relabel`** (iso-invariant)
+ **`exists_movedAt_of_not_isBase`** (brick-1 → `MovedAt`/`forcedNode` bridge, = converse of `isBase_of_no_moved`).
**RE-SCOPED REMAINING RRU work (the four items below are NOT from-scratch builds):** (1)✅ progress lemma = brick 1;
(2)✅ `R(G)` object = `rigidResidue`; (3)✅ iso-invariance = `rigidResidue_relabel`; (4) termination-at-rigid:
`forcedNode_isBase` gives a base in ONE forced step (over-individualizes the whole support — CORRECT for the handoff,
choice-free/iso-invariant; the efficiency-optimal one-rep-per-orbit base is smaller = the open recovery layer).
**What is GENUINELY still open (the real RRU frontier):** (a) **wire the descent to *compute* `rigidResidue`** —
refinement-recovery of `forcedNode` (`movedSet_eq_nonsingletonCells_of_recoverable` is the recoverable-node half; general
computation is the open recovery content, declassing §5 item 3); (b)✅ **hand `R(G)` to Phase 2** as its typed input —
**DONE 2026-07-10, new module `ChainDescent/Phase2Handoff.lean` (in `build.sh`, axiom-clean):** `handoffBase adj :=
rigidResidue adj` + `handoff_isRigid` (rigid, unconditional) + `orbitPartition_handoff_iff_eq` (the "no residual symmetry
at the handoff" fact = Phase 2 is a genuinely rigid search) + `handoffBase_relabel` (iso-invariant) + the **Phase-2 solver
contract** `Solver`/`Sound`/`IsoInvariant` (stated in `labelledAdj`/`relabelAdj` shape to compose with Publication ①a/①b/①c).
Algorithm R is the future witness of `Sound`/`IsoInvariant`; (c) **connect to Publication** — `rigidResidue` is the Phase-2
input, distinct from `descentCanon`'s discrete leaf, so the ①/② object-unification must account for the handoff.
**★★★ RRU SKELETON LANDED (2026-07-10, `Phase2Handoff.lean` `namespace RRU`, axiom-clean, in `build.sh`) — the
reachability obligation is now ON THE BOARD as a reduction.** Proposed central architecture (user): `canonForm? =
phase2 ∘ phase1`, RRU = the Phase-1 deliverable. The three RRU guarantees are STATED and REDUCED to two named
obligations (statements, not discharge): `reachesRigid` (③-side, nothing non-`IsBase`) + `isoInvariant` (①b/①c-side)
both reduce to **`ComputesResidue p1 := ∀ adj, p1 adj = rigidResidue adj`** (the descent's handoff base IS the
iso-invariant `R(G)` — THE open recovery/confinement content, `movedSet_eq_nonsingletonCells_of_recoverable` = its
recoverable-node half); `Poly cost := ∀ adj, cost adj ≤ n` (witness `defaultSpineChain_reaches_leaf`). Capstone
**`RRU.rru`**: `{ComputesResidue, Poly} ⟹ (∀ adj IsBase) ∧ (poly) ∧ (iso-invariant)`. **KEY CLARIFICATION recorded:** the
built `rigidResidue`/`handoffBase` is the *target object* (rigid + iso-invariant, DONE); the missing "it is REACHED" =
exactly `ComputesResidue`, and for ② it must be the *algorithmic* descent (semantic `forcedNode` is GI-hard) whose
correctness IS the confinement payoff (the algorithm can't test `IsBase` — GI-hard — so it stops at oracle-saturation;
"saturated ⟹ `IsBase`" = the seal/Cameron content). RRU is NOT one of the 6 Publication obligations — it's the Phase-1
half they bundle away; surfacing it factors ②/③ cleanly.
**★★★ `ComputesResidue` — FIRST DISCHARGE LANDED (2026-07-10, root/WL-1 case, `Phase2Handoff.lean` `namespace RRU`,
axiom-clean, in `build.sh`).** Concrete `phase1Root adj := Finset.univ.filter (non-singleton 1-WL cells at ∅)` (the
visible support at the root, refinement-computable) + **`computesResidue_phase1Root_of_recoverable`**: `(∀ adj,
OrbitRecoverableAt adj P₀ ∅) → ComputesResidue phase1Root`, via `movedSet_eq_nonsingletonCells_of_recoverable` (+
`rigidResidue = movedSet` at `∅`). So `ComputesResidue` is REDUCED to the project's existing recovery predicate
`OrbitRecoverableAt`. Payoff corollaries `phase1Root_{reachesRigid,isoInvariant}_of_recoverable` (the RRU guarantees hold
for the concrete `phase1Root` on the recoverable domain). **HONEST SCOPE: this is the `k=0`/WL-1 base case** —
`∀ adj, OrbitRecoverableAt … ∅` FAILS at node-4/CFI/multipedes (1-WL cells coarser than orbits), where `phase1Root`
over-approximates the support and the ITERATIVE descent (individualize–refine–repeat + per-level recovery backed by
confinement) is required.
**★★★ `ComputesResidue` — VERTEX-TRANSITIVE DISCHARGE LANDED (2026-07-10, NO recovery citation, axiom-clean).**
Refactored to a per-graph core **`phase1Root_eq_rigidResidue_of_recoverableAt`** (`OrbitRecoverableAt adj P₀ ∅ →
phase1Root adj = rigidResidue adj`), then the key new result **`phase1Root_eq_rigidResidue_of_pretransitive`**: if the
`P₀`-automorphism group is transitive at `∅` (orbit relation total), root recovery is **VACUOUS** (`cell=cell → orbit`
conclusion always true ⟹ `CellsAreOrbits` free), so `phase1Root` computes `R(G)` UNCONDITIONALLY. This closes
`ComputesResidue` (per-graph) on the entire **vertex-transitive-at-root slice** — DRGs, schemes, Cayley graphs, and
Cameron residues realised as whole graphs — with no recovery hypothesis. **Machinery survey finding (recorded so it isn't
re-walked):** `theorem_1_HOR_at_depth`/`RecoverableByDepth`/`recoverableByDepth_{cfi,scheme}` give recovery at a
*discrete* base (free but trivial — `cellsAreOrbits_of_discrete`), NOT root orbits; so computing `movedSet(∅)` for a
NON-transitive, non-WL-1 graph (CFI/multipede) is genuinely the WL-dim wall — it needs the cross-branch harvest
(`coversOrbits_of_realizers` reproduces root orbits from deeper recovery), a separate large build.
**NEXT = the CFI/non-transitive case via the cross-branch harvest (`coversOrbits_of_realizers` / `matchOracleSeq`) — the
genuinely-hard remainder of `ComputesResidue`; OR reframe: the assume-VT canonizer never computes `movedSet(∅)` exactly
(it prunes) so `ComputesResidue = p1 = rigidResidue` may be STRONGER than the assume-VT route needs (its iso-invariance
comes from reconciliation/X3, not from a canonical base) — worth deciding before the big harvest build. Then factor
`canonForm? = phase2 ∘ phase1` (c). Phase-2 solver (Algorithm R) = independent thread.**

**The headline (2026-06-17).** The seal `reachesRigidOrCameron` is assembled and axiom-clean. Its live canonical
capstone `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaBoundedMinMult` stands **`modulo {G3 + hSmallAutThin + hcatch + hImprim}`**. The
three cleanup passes this session (`hcatch`, the separation engine, `hImprim`) reached a consistent conclusion:

> **The three non-G3 hypotheses are facets of ONE open object — the residue/constituent WL-recovery (`s(C)`) core —
> not four independent gaps.** In honest substance the seal is **`modulo {G3 + [one WL-recovery / s(C) core]}`.**

So "what's left" is short: **one research core** (conditional on the cited classification G3), plus a small amount of
**citation-formalization** and **one buildable infrastructure piece** (`EdgeGeneratesFromSet`), and the **forward IR
solver** (gated on the same core). There is **no long cleanup list**.

## 1. The `modulo` set — what each hypothesis is, and its true status

The live capstone is `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaBoundedMinMult` (CascadeAffine §S-gate2). Capstone map:
[`PublicTheoremIndex.md`](../GraphCanonizationProofs/PublicTheoremIndex.md) seal section.

| Hypothesis | What it is | True status | Collapses to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G3** (`hClassify`, `PrimitiveCCClassification`) | "large primitive ⟹ Cameron section" — the cited classification | **Citation** (Babai/Sun–Wilmes/Kivva). The one citation that *may stay cited* (CFSG-based). | — (kept) |
| **hSmallAutThin** | "small-Aut primitive residue ⟹ bounded `minMult`" = thick⟹large-Aut | **REDUCED to AFFINE this session (§9.9.18–18b):** for the SCHURIAN residue, Cameron+Liebeck+Skresanov ⟹ the residue is **affine** = `{1-dim cyclotomic — CITED (Ponomarenko-2-sep) + forms-graphs (c)–(f) — UNCITED, bounded-WL-dim OPEN}`. So **not** fully closed-mod-citations; the forms-graph part `{affine-polar, alternating, half-spin, Suzuki–Tits}` is the precise open residue — but now **explicit & CONSTRUCTIBLE** (refuting "no witness") and **PROBED across 3 classes: affine-polar `VO^-_4(q)` (q=2..5), alternating `A(5,2)`, Suzuki–Tits `VSz(8)` all SHATTER at base ≪ √n** (§9.9.18c, `Probe_FormsGraphs`; `VSz(8)` params validate exactly) — hSmallAutThin confirmed on the first unbounded-`s` (s=−3..−57) witnesses. **★ FIRST INSTANCE PROVED (2026-06-24): `VO⁻₄(3)` SEALED** (`vo4minus_seal`, axiom-clean) — the affine-polar minus-form residue is no longer only probed; open content is now the **generalization** to all `(ε,m,q)` + families (d)–(f) + the cited seam (plan §11). Sub-exp floor `n^{1/5}` (§2). | the affine slice; open residue = the **generalization** of the forms-graph families (plan §11, AUDIT-S done) — `VO⁻₄(3)` proved, the rest open. Non-schurian wall → IR-solver row 4 (§4). |
| **hcatch** | "1-WL cell ⟹ 2-WL fiber" = CFI-1992 Thm 5.2 (dimWL exchange) | At a complete extension `⟺ warmRefine discrete`. Free where 1-WL discretizes; residual = the `s(C)` certificate. | the core (§9.9.14–15) |
| **hImprim** | "imprimitive ⟹ block-recovered ∨ abelian-consumed" | Block-tower infra **built**; content = constituent WL-recovery (A2-ii), one tower-layer down. | the core (§9.9.16) |

**The collapse, precisely.** `hcatch` (1-WL↔2-WL exchange) and `hImprim` (constituent recovery) both reduce, via
landed machinery, to the same content as `hSmallAutThin`: *does the bounded-depth relation-count profile separate the
residue's orbits at a bounded base?* — the `s(C)` self-detection certificate (`RelCountsDetermineOrbit` /
`PersistentTwinYieldsBlock`). Deep-dives: [`chain-descent-a2-potential-route.md`](./chain-descent-a2-potential-route.md)
§9.9.14 (hcatch), §9.9.15 (the engine), §9.9.16 (hImprim).

**The 2026-06-17 reframe of that core (§9.9.17–18a).** The `s(C)` core, **for the seal's scope**, is the *schurian*
residue (the seal is typed on `SchurianScheme`; the non-schurian / high-WL-dim term `DiscretizesAtBases` is
provably split off to the IR-solver — §4, route §9.9.18a). Closure-angle work (§9.9.17) showed the "⟹ block" escape is
*vacuous on the primitive floor* (lemma `persistentTwinYieldsBlock_iff_yieldsLarge_of_primitive`), so the crux is the
2-closure deficiency `G^(2)_T/G_T`; Skresanov's rank-3 2-closure theory (§9.9.18) then shows **every small-Aut
non-geometric schurian rank-3 residue is affine** (Cameron kills almost-simple/grid; only affine survives). **C1
(§9.9.18b) then splits the affine target:** `{1-dim cyclotomic — CITED (Ponomarenko-2-sep / δ′) + forms-graphs (c)–(f):
affine-polar / alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits — UNCITED, bounded-WL-dim OPEN}` ((b) bilinear forms is excluded as
geometric). So the schurian `s(C)` core is **mostly** reduced to citations, with the **forms-graph residue (c)–(f) still
open** — but now **explicit and constructible** (refuting "no witness"; the probe-record's 0 falsifiers were bounded-`s`
node-3 catalogue data, never these growing-`q` families). They are *probable* (small-Aut ⟹ group base `O(log n)`); the
open question is bounded-WL-dim for these 4 named classical schemes — far more tractable than "all SRGs". The
genuinely-open *uncited non-schurian* wall is the IR-solver row 4 (§4) — never the seal's obligation. Caveat (separate):
`SchurianScheme` is a carried model assumption (`orbitalScheme H`), not discharged.

**Citation-free / lighter endpoints already landed** (use these where the family fits — they carry *less*):
- `…viaRainbowRank` — rank-≥4 amorphic (rainbow-rigid) families, `modulo {G3 + hImprim}`, **no hcatch/largeness**.
- `…viaSpielman` — the **fully-citable, Cameron-free sub-exp floor**, carries only `hSpielman` (no G3/hImprim).
- `…viaG0powNeg` / `…viaG0powNeg`-family — the affine `H={±1}` family, δ′ closure **discharged** (not carried).
- `…viaCompleteBase` / `…viaBoundedMultiplicity` — node-2 discrete-base pipeline, `modulo {G3 + hcatch + hImprim}`.

## 2. Citation replacement — the table

Policy (user): **eventually all citations except maybe Babai (G3/CFSG) are to be fully built in Lean.** A citation is
carried as a labeled hypothesis (never a fresh `axiom`), so the build stays axiom-clean; "replacing" it means proving
it in-project and discharging the hypothesis.

> **▶ The discharge routes + methodology now live in their own tracker:
> [`chain-descent-citation-discharge.md`](./chain-descent-citation-discharge.md)** (NEW 2026-07-04). It carries the
> full citation register (incl. the Route-C citations, below in §3a), the **found discharge routes** (`SuzukiFormsDetermine`
> ✅ DONE via 2nd-derivative recovery; `NondegQuadricDeterminesForm` + `JointVarietyDeterminesFamily` route found via
> vanishing-space transport for `q=p`; the FTPG residue), and the M1–M5 playbook for attempting a discharge. This table
> is the *what-is-carried* census; that doc is the *how-to-remove-it*.

| Citation | Where carried | Faithful source | Replace? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G3 — primitive-CC / Cameron classification** | `hClassify` (all capstones) | Babai ITCS 2014 (rank 3) + J.Algebra 2015 (II); Kivva JCTB 164 (2024) (rank 4); Sun–Wilmes (`exp(n^{1/3})` threshold) | **Maybe not** (CFSG-based — the one allowed to stay cited) | The "or Cameron" escape. |
| **CFI-1992 Thm 5.2 — dimWL exchange** | `hcatch` | Cai–Fürer–Immerman 1992 Thm 5.2; Ponomarenko arXiv:2006.13592 eq. (41) | **Yes**, but largely **moot for the residue**: collapses onto the `s(C)` core; needs a `dimWL` framework to state verbatim. | Free where 1-WL discretizes. |
| **Spielman — primitive-SRG discretization** | `hSpielman` (`…viaSpielman`) | Spielman, STOC 1996 (`Õ(n^{1/3})` base) | **Yes** (a genuine but large WL/SRG result) | Gives the honest sub-exp floor, Cameron-free. **DELTA (2026-06-17, lit. check):** the SRG-iso *floor value* is `exp(Õ(n^{1/5}))` (Babai–Chen–Sun–Teng–Wilmes, FOCS 2013); `n^{1/3}` is the broader-PCC bound. Spielman's *individualize-to-discrete-at-base* form is what `hSpielman` consumes; confirm BCSTW gives a base statement before re-citing. See route §9.9.17 / [[reference_srg_wl_literature_2026-06-17]]. |
| **Affine cyclotomic 2-separability** | `…affineSlice` | Ponomarenko arXiv:2006.13592 Thm 1.1 | **Yes** — superseded for sub-families by the citation-free δ′/rainbow routes (`viaG0powNeg`, `viaRainbowRank`). | |
| **Babai SRG structure (node-4 form)** | `hSmallAutThin` | Babai ITCS 2014 + Kivva (the *structure*, at sub-exp threshold) | **= the research core** — at poly threshold it is *open*, not a citation. | The wall. |

**Net:** the only citation expected to remain is **G3 (Babai/CFSG)**. `hcatch`/`hImprim` are not really "citations to
replace" — they are the project's own `s(C)` core in disguise (§1). Spielman and the affine 2-sep are genuine
citations that *can* be built but are not on the critical path (the δ′/rainbow routes already bypass them per-family).

**One object, three faces** (the residue, the 1-WL↔2-WL exchange, the imprimitive constituents). The open question:
*does the bounded-depth relation-count profile separate the small-Aut primitive residue's orbits at a bounded base?*
- **Status:** open, GI-adjacent. No constructible falsifier across every probe (sporadics, trivial-Aut, cospectral
  mates, Doob/Hamming twists, k-WL ladder — all negative). Not directly attackable by covers/regularity/WL-level/twists
  (all closed, §9.9.10–12). The honest characterization: *is the WL-dim gap `base − b(Aut)` bounded for the residue?*
- **Intended discharge:** ~~the fusion / closed-subset closure (`schemeEquiv_trans`) for `PersistentTwinYieldsBlock`~~
  **— CORRECTED (2026-06-17, route §9.9.17): the block escape is VACUOUS on the primitive floor** (a primitive scheme
  has no nontrivial proper `ClosedSubset`, so `PersistentTwinYieldsBlock` collapses to `¬Separates → IsLarge`;
  lemma `persistentTwinYieldsBlock_iff_yieldsLarge_of_primitive`). The fusion-closure block construction discharges
  only the *imprimitive* case (already `hImprim`). The primitive crux is irreducibly the **2-closure deficiency**
  `G^(2)_T / G_T` = `s(X)` wall, with no block shortcut. Project verdict unchanged: *won't close from Mathlib alone.*
- **The closure angle, precisely (route §9.9.17):** the open content factors as (A) `Separable` + (B) the transport
  + (C) a bounded group base; **(C) is FREE** (`exists_greedy_base_le_log`, `b(G)=O(log n)` for small Aut). The open
  (A)+(B) = *the point extension recovers Aut-orbits at a bounded base* = no 2-closure deficiency. Its group-theoretic
  form is **Skresanov's rank-3 2-closure** theory (`G^(2)` structure) — the closure-angle and Skresanov leads merge.
  **Concrete next:** test whether Skresanov's rank-3 `G^(2)` description trivialises the deficiency at a bounded base
  for the affine residue (an affine-rank-3 carve capstone, sibling to the cyclotomic slice). See [[reference_srg_wl_literature_2026-06-17]].
- **Floors available now:** sub-exp via `…viaSpielman` (fully citable, Cameron-free; floor value `exp(Õ(n^{1/5}))`, §2 DELTA).

- **★ Stage A LANDED (2026-06-18, axiom-clean):** `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaAffineFormScheme` (CascadeAffine.lean,
  `PublicTheoremIndex.md:1207`) is the conditional capstone for the schurian node-4 forms-graph residue. It carries the
  free group base `IsBase … T` + the certificate `hFormCert : RelCountsDetermineOrbit … T` (the **only open content**),
  composing the landed depth-`k` engine + base + `…viaSpielman`; **no `hSmallAutThin`**. The route is validated
  end-to-end; the open content is now exactly `hFormCert`.
- **★ Stage B.0 LANDED (2026-06-18, axiom-clean):** `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaOrthogonalForm` + the quadratic-form
  infrastructure (`isometryGroup`, `coords_determine`, `polar_eq_of_sub`, `frameBase`) (CascadeAffine.lean §OrthogonalForm,
  `PublicTheoremIndex.md:1210-1217`). For any nondegenerate-polar `Q` on `F_p^d`, the **isometry** group `O(Q)` affine
  scheme discretizes at the basis-frame (size `d+1`) and seals via **depth-1** — the orbit-of-difference determines
  `Q(v−t)`, recovering form coords (`coords_determine`, the crux's Witt-free back-half). **Caveat:** `O(Q)` is the *finer*
  orthogonal scheme, **not yet** the rank-3 SRG `VO^ε`. **Next = Stage B.1**: the **similitude** group `ΓO(Q)` (rank-3
  SRG; depth-1 → isotropy bits only) + the genuine two-round **count** crux (Route A; back-half = `coords_determine`),
  `d=4 VO^ε_4(q)` first. Residual = the non-isotropic shell. Plan: [`chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md`](./chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md) §1–§2 (now `VO⁻₄(3)` SEALED) + §11 (generalization).
- **★ Stage B.1 LANDED (2026-06-18, axiom-clean):** the **similitude** group + the node-4 conditional capstone —
  `similitudeGroup` (`GO(Q)`), `neg_mem_similitudeGroup`, `isometry_le_similitude`, `SimilitudeFrameSeparates` (the
  named count crux), `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaSimilitudeForm` (CascadeAffine.lean §OrthogonalForm,
  `PublicTheoremIndex.md:1218-1222`). The genuine rank-3 SRG `VO^ε` residue (`affineScheme (similitudeGroup Q)`) seals
  once `SimilitudeFrameSeparates Q` holds; open content isolated to that one predicate. **Carries NO `hSmallAutThin`.**
- **★ RESEARCH-CORE CHECKPOINT CONFIRMED (2026-06-18, axiom-clean):** `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaCountsDetermineFrameQ`
  + `CountsDetermineFrameQ` + `similitudeFrameSeparates_of_countsDetermineFrameQ` + `FrameCountsAgree`
  (`PublicTheoremIndex.md:1223-1226`). The chain is now confirmed END-TO-END modulo one front-half predicate:
  `CountsDetermineFrameQ` (= Witt + Gauss) →[`coords_determine`, landed]→ `SimilitudeFrameSeparates` →[landed]→ seal.
  So the research core is **sound** (the heavy machinery, once built, provably closes), and the B.0 back-half
  `coords_determine` is confirmed to compose. The entire open content is isolated to `CountsDetermineFrameQ`.
- **★ WITT-BOUNDARY CHECKPOINT CONFIRMED (2026-06-18, axiom-clean):** `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaIsotropyCounts` +
  `OrbitIsIsotropyClass` (Witt deliverable) + `IsotropyCountsRecoverFrameQ` (Gauss deliverable) +
  `countsDetermineFrameQ_of_orbitIsIsotropyClass` (`PublicTheoremIndex.md:1227-1233`). Splits the open content along
  the Witt | Gauss boundary: `OrbitIsIsotropyClass` + `IsotropyCountsRecoverFrameQ` → `CountsDetermineFrameQ` → seal.
  B.1c-ii's exact target (pure isotropy-class counts ⟹ frame `Q`-profile, no opaque relations) is now confirmed.
- **★★ CORRECTION (2026-06-18 later) — the B.1c predicates are MIS-SHAPED; the bullets just above are SUPERSEDED.**
  Finite probe over `VO^ε_4(3)`: `IsotropyCountsRecoverFrameQ` / `CountsDetermineFrameQ` / `SimilitudeFrameSeparates`
  are **FALSE at the standard frame** for `VO^-` (one-round count shell-blind via the frame's `e_i`-swap isometry).
  The scheme still discretizes (iterated WL) ⟹ bounded-WL-dim holds; fix = a **symmetry-broken base** (`≈ d+2`, greedy
  size-4 at q=3) where the one-round count IS injective. Landed B.1 capstones (`via{IsotropyCounts,CountsDetermineFrameQ,
  SimilitudeForm}`, idx 1221-1233) axiom-clean but **unprovable as stated → need reformulation** around base
  `T = frameBase ∪ {p}`; the "recover-Q-profile-then-`coords_determine`" architecture is wrong for minus-type. Correct
  target = **direct count-injectivity at the symmetry-broken base** → `discrete_of_kRoundRelationSeparates` → seal (no
  `coords_determine`). **Gauss-sum toolkit BUILT** (13 axiom-clean lemmas, `ChainDescent/ScratchGauss.lean`, WIP/Mathlib-
  only): A/A2/B1/B2/B3/eval/scaling/`card_quadForm_eq`/D1/`sum_addChar_multiQuad`/helpers. Remaining = k-fold count
  (generalize `count2_eq_charsum`; inner = `sum_addChar_multiQuad`) + inclusion-exclusion + injectivity at the broken
  base + bridge + PORT. **B.0 (`viaOrthogonalForm`, isometry `O(Q)`) UNAFFECTED.** Witt (B.1c-i `OrbitIsIsotropyClass`)
  still needed for orbit=isotropy-class. Authoritative: plan doc STATUS (the ⚠/⚠⚠ boxes).
- **★ WITT REMOVED FROM THE CRITICAL PATH (2026-06-20, axiom-clean, full build green).** `OrbitIsIsotropyClass`
  (the Mathlib-absent "heaviest piece") is **off the seal's critical path.** New axiom-clean decls in
  `CascadeAffine.lean §OrthogonalForm` (`PublicTheoremIndex.md:1243-1248`): the easy-half `RelationRefinesIsotropy` is
  **discharged Witt-free outright** (`relationRefinesIsotropy_similitude`, via similitude-invariance), the bridge
  `separatesAtBase_of_isotropySeparates_weak` needs only it, and the capstone
  **`reachesRigidOrCameron_viaIsotropySeparates_wittFree`** seals the `VO^ε` residue carrying ONLY a bounded base + the
  Gauss target `IsotropySeparatesAtBase Q T` — NO Witt. Witt is needed only for the cosmetic rank-3 identification the
  seal never uses. **⟹ proving `IsotropySeparatesAtBase Q T₉` seals `VO⁻₄(3)` modulo `{G3}` ALONE.** The "capstone also
  needs `OrbitIsIsotropyClass` (parallel Witt track)" framing below/above is SUPERSEDED.
- **★ STEP-4 BUILD UNDERWAY via the LEMMA A / LEMMA B split (2026-06-20).** The live route now proves
  `IsotropySeparatesAtBase Q T₉` **directly** (Lemma A = "isotropic-incidence count = explicit Gram-function on
  nondeg configs"; Lemma B = "counts recover `u`"), **superseding the `QProfileSeparatesAtBase` framing** of the bullet
  below. Uses the **size-9 base `T₉`** (avoids degenerate cases). Landed axiom-clean (WIP scratch, NOT in build):
  **A-M1+A-M2** (`ChainDescent/IsotropicIncidenceCount.lean`: cone-count → homogeneous level-set, for invertible config Gram) and
  **B-M1+B-M2-bridge** (`ChainDescent/ProfileReduction.lean`: antecedent → incidence-agreement, + `y=0` correction). The
  two novel reductions are done; **NEXT = A-M3** (`card_quadForm_eq` on subspace `Uᗮ`) → A-M4 → B-M3 → ASM. Authoritative:
  plan [`chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md`](./chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-plan.md) §1 (decl map) + §11 (roadmap); full build records in the plan's archive.
- **★★★ CURRENT (2026-06-18 HANDOFF) — reformulation + M0–M3 LANDED; the bullets above are landed history.** The
  reformulation around a symmetry-broken base is DONE (`SeparatesAtBase` / `IsotropySeparatesAtBase` /
  `reachesRigidOrCameron_via{SymmetryBrokenBase,IsotropySeparates}`, the frame-locked predicates ⚠ SUPERSEDED in-source);
  the Gauss toolkit is PORTED to a real module **`ChainDescent/GaussCount.lean`** (18+ axiom-clean lemmas); the consumer
  **`ChainDescent/FormsGraphConcrete.lean`** has the M0–M3 chain (transport, fine→coarse conversion, the M3 reduction).
  **The ENTIRE remaining Gauss-work content is now ONE open predicate `QProfileSeparatesAtBase Q T`** (counts at
  `T = frameBase∪{2e₃}` recover the `Q`-profile; probe-validated `VO^-_4(3)` 81/81, UNPROVED). `isotropySeparates_of_qProfileSeparates`
  + `coords_determine` reduce the seal to it; M4 is wiring but **blocked** on it. **Two viable discharge routes fully
  expanded in the plan's archive (`Archive/ChainDescent/chain-descent-formsgraph-wldim-archive.md`) §10:** (1) explicit
  Gauss/incidence `Z(S)` computation (Witt-free, recommended; open step = a char-sum inversion), (3) structural perp-graph
  + Witt frame-rigidity (blocks on building Witt). Carrying the predicate as a certificate is RULED OUT (quality bar). Key
  constraint: `isoClass` is shell-blind ⟹ pointwise-count machinery off-path; recovery is the joint `Z(S)`. **Authoritative:
  plan §9 (milestones) + §10 (handoff).**

### 3b. Buildable non-research infrastructure — `EdgeGeneratesFromSet`
The **checkable multi-base isolation closure** — the relation-count analogue of `dominatorReachable_of_rainbowRank`:
a structural sufficient condition that *produces* the `s(C)` separation certificate for a family (makes recovery
checkable). The single-base `EdgeGenerates` exists (`Scheme.lean`) but fails on cyclotomic/catalogue schemes; the
multi-base version is deferred ([`chain-descent-self-detection-plan.md`](./chain-descent-self-detection-plan.md) §9.3).
- **Status:** buildable, moderate; **not on the seal's critical path** (it adds checkability, not closure).
- It is the *one* shared piece behind the engine (§9.9.15) and `hImprim` (§9.9.16).

### 3c. Citation formalization (optional, off critical path)
- **Spielman** → fully built `…viaSpielman` (large WL/SRG result).
- **Affine cyclotomic 2-sep** → mostly superseded by δ′/rainbow per-family; build only if a uniform affine closure is wanted.
- **CFI-1992 dimWL exchange** → needs a `dimWL` framework; moot for the residue (§1). Lowest priority.

### 3d. Node-2 polish (optional)
A *uniform* rainbow rank for a parametric amorphic family (generalize `clebschZ4`/`clebschScheme` off `n=16`) →
feeds `…viaRainbowRank` / `…viaCompleteBase`. Honest scope (§9.9.9b): the schurian rainbow-rigid amorphic instances
are **affine** (leg-B-adjacent); the genuinely-new non-affine ones are non-schurian (not residues). So this is
citation-reduction on the affine amorphic slice, **not** new territory and **cannot** approach node 4 (rank-counting,
§9.9.9a). Low priority.

## 4. The IR-blind-spot solver (the forward payoff)
**Doc:** [`chain-descent-ir-blindspot-solver.md`](./chain-descent-ir-blindspot-solver.md) (STATUS first).
Canonizes the **rigid** residue (incl. the multipede / IR-blind-spot that 1-WL cannot discretize) in polynomial time.
- **Gating (⚠ applies to the §1–§10 route ONLY):** the *original* potential-drop plan's polynomiality is delivered
  by A2 (bounded WL-dim of the residue: `c(X_T), k(X_T) = O(1)` at an `O(1)` base). **The live option-2 route (IR doc
  §11) is NOT A2-gated** — it is exact linear algebra (F₂/ring Gaussian–Smith), poly by *bounded arity*. A2 is stalled
  at node-4; option-2 is not waiting on it.
- **★ POST-SKRESANOV SPLIT (2026-06-17, §9.9.18a) — this is where the genuine wall now lives.** A2 is one predicate
  (bounded WL-dim) over two residue classes. On the **schurian** residue (the seal's scope, §3a) A2 is delivered by
  the Skresanov reduction (residue is affine ⟹ affine slice, mod citations). On the **non-schurian** residue — the
  IR-solver's "row 4" (generic unbounded-`s` SRG, multipede) — A2 may **fail**, and that is exactly where the canonizer
  **flags** ("polynomial-or-flag"). So §3a's reduction does **not** cover the IR-solver's case; the genuinely-uncited
  open research is **this non-schurian row 4**, which was never the seal's obligation (it is `DiscretizesAtBases`, split
  off by `stablyRecoverable_iff_symmetric_and_bases`). Closing it = closing the *overall*-canonizer poly wall.
- **Status:** *solver not built;* prerequisites landed (deferral architecture, direction-blind canonizer substrate,
  the potential-descent engine `exists_potential_descent`, A2's consumer chain).
- **★ ROW 4 IS NOW UNDER ACTIVE ATTACK — "option 2" (2026-06-20, IR doc §11).** The flag set is *attackable*, not just
  acceptable: the multipede is **F₂-linear**, and the descent (WL) = F₂ **unit-propagation**, which stalls where
  **Gaussian elimination** does not. **Layers A–C DONE** (probe-/prototype-clean): the rigid gap is real & constructible
  (var-regular meager expander: `dim ker = 0` but descent forcing `Θ(n)`); WL = unit-prop verified on real multipedes;
  the F₂ system `H` is **soundly extractable from the descent alone** (no gadget recognition). **Layer D
  milestones D-M0–D-M4 DONE as probes** (2026-06-20, `Option2ExtractionProbe.cs`: extract → twist-solve →
  canonical adjacency, scramble-invariant + complete on rigid multipedes; Z₂ composition via cascade) — but
  **entirely inside the Tests project; production has NO rigid solver and no Smith normal form**, `ChainDescent`
  still brute-force-branches or flags at `target == -1`. **Productionization = the roadmap §11.12 (B1–B6 C# / P1–P4
  Lean), the next planned step**, C# first, wiring at `ChainDescent.Search target == -1` **as the stepwise
  alternating engine** (run-instead-of-branch, consume verified kernel symmetry + refine + loop, defer only on mutual
  stall; §11.11 + STATUS). The row-space read generalizes the *deferred/unbuilt* `LinearOracle`
  (`TwistConstruction.cs` is the `ker`-half). **★ Immediate next (2026-07-11): design the ring FIRST** — the Z₄/ring
  validation was ephemeral Python that evaporated, so B1's ring-awareness must be re-anchored by a fresh
  ring-inference probe before build. **Scope/flag floor** (honest): option
  2 absorbs the canonical **F₂-multipede**; the **ring-varying** residue (Lichter, FPC+rank ≠ P) + unbounded-arity +
  non-WL-easy-base stay the flag floor. Memory: [[project_option2_f2_gap_2026-06-20]].

```

**Bottom line.** The seal's open content reduces to the *schurian* `s(C)` core; this session's Skresanov reduction
shows that core is **affine**, and C1 sharpens the residue to **four explicit constructible forms-graph families**
(affine-polar / alternating / half-spin / Suzuki–Tits) whose bounded-WL-dimension is *open but uncited* — the
cyclotomic part is already cited. So the SEAL is *mostly* citations-away, with one precisely-characterized,
probable, *probable-by-experiment* open residue (no longer a mysterious wall). The **genuine uncited research wall is
the non-schurian IR-solver row 4** (the forward payoff), never the seal's obligation; the canonizer stays
"polynomial-or-flag" with the flag set = exactly that row 4.

*Maintenance: update §1's modulo table when a capstone's `#print axioms` carry-set changes; update §3 as items land;
keep the deep-dives (`chain-descent-a2-potential-route.md` §9.9.x, `-ir-blindspot-solver.md`, `-self-detection-plan.md`)
authoritative and this doc a one-screen map.*


User notes: current reaches rigid form is uncomputable, and not linked up with the other lemmas.
At some point the runtime should be able to run it as well, but likely rigid phase should be started before that piece.
