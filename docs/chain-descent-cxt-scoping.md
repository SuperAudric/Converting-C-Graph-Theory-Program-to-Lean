## 0. The target, precisely (what A2 must deliver)

A1 reduced the seal's open input to a single threshold. A2's deliverable (the crisp interface, `§CC.19`):

> **Bound `c(X_{T₀}), k(X_{T₀}) = O(1)` at one `O(1)` base `T₀`** — then `allSingletonFiber_of_card_gt_subset` makes
> every `T ⊇ T₀` with `|T| > (k(X_{T₀})−1)·c(X_{T₀})` a base of `X`, and the seal closes.

Here `X_T = pointExtension (S.toCoherentConfig hne) T` for the residue `S = orbitalScheme H` (**primitive, small-`|Aut|`,
non-abelian, non-Cameron** schurian; bullseye rank 3–4), `c = indistinguishingNumber`, `k = maxValency`. This is the
**bounded WL-dimension / bounded base number `b(X)`** of the residue — the genuine `s(X)` content. The Lean objects are
all landed (`§CC.11`–`§CC.19` + the seal wiring `reachesRigidOrCameron_viaBoundedExtensionParams`, `§S-gate2`); only the
bound itself is open.

**Calibration (the bar is `O(log n)` base, which IS polynomial).** IR cost `≈ 2^{O(b)}`, so `b = O(log n)` ⟹
`2^{O(log n)} = n^{O(1)}` — polynomial. So the target is not strictly `c, k = O(1)` — it is small enough to keep the base
`O(log n)` (e.g. `c = O(1), k = O(log n)` gives `(k−1)c = O(log n)` ⟹ `O(log n)` base ⟹ poly). The only genuine *non*-poly
risk is the largeness threshold: **M2-Q4** — for *bounded-rank* primitive non-Cameron CCs `|Aut|` is polynomially bounded
(Babai rank-3 / Kivva rank-4) ⟹ `O(log n)` base ⟹ genuinely polynomial; in *unbounded* rank only sub-exponential
`|Aut| ≤ exp(Õ(n^{1/3}))` is proved. **The residue is rank 3–4, so claim *polynomial* there; the general statement is
sub-exponential-base.** Do **not** treat an `O(log n)` base as a problem.

---

## 1. Why everything reduces to `c(X_T)` (no escape)

| Route | Owed | Reduces to |
|---|---|---|
| **δ′** (citation-free, the landed route) | a pinning rank on `X_T` | forced-triangle abundance = `c(X_T)=O(1)` (A1 §CC.18 made this `(k−1)c<\|T\|`) |
| **(A)+(B)** (cite Thm 4.1) | `DominationCondition` on `X_T` | (i) domination ⟸ `n > 3·c(X_T)·k(X_T)²` ⟸ `c(X_T)=O(1)` |

The **`k`-half is "free-ish"**: `maxValency(X_T) ≤ |Aut_T|` (orbit–stabiliser) and the greedy base shrinks `|Aut_T|`
geometrically (`exists_greedy_base_le_log`) — **but** this bounds the *group* side; the WL-valency `k(X_T)` can exceed
the orbit valency (the WL-dim gap), so `k(X_T)=O(1)` is itself WL content, not free. The **`c`-half is the irreducible
crux** for both routes. Citing Thm 4.1 only repackages `c(X_T)` as condition (i); it doesn't remove it. **All uniform
statements of A2 are inter-derivable and equal:** `c(X_T)=O(1)` ⟺ bounded `b(X)` ⟺ bounded WL-dim ⟺ schurian
self-detection (`RelCountsDetermineOrbit` at base+O(1)) ⟺ `s(X)=O(1)`. There is no reformulation that cheaply collapses
the family-ladder — a "pattern" that resolves it *is* this theorem (§5).

---

## 2. The crux is NOT free-citable — confirmed twice (M2 + A2-research)

`c(X_T)=O(1)` is the separability/schurity number `s(X)` of the residue being bounded. **Two deep-research passes confirm
it is OPEN / not citable:**

- **M2 (2026-06-13, 17 sources):** no citable theorem bounds `c(X)` / `s(X)` for a primitive small/non-Cameron CC. Group
  base-size theory (Halasi–Liebeck–Maróti `b(G) ≤ 2log|G|/log n + 24`; Burness `b(G)≤7`) bounds the *group* base, and
  `b(G) ≤ b(X)` — the gap `b(X) − b(G)` is exactly the `s(X)` content. Evdokimov–Ponomarenko give constant `s(C)/t(C)`
  only for *named* families and only in the *imprimitive* 3/2-homogeneous case.
- **A2-research (2026-06-14, 19 sources, 20/25 verified):** confirms it from the *distinct* SRG-WL-dimension literature.
  Babai rank-3 (I/II) and Kivva rank-4 (JCTB'23) bound **|Aut| / minimal-degree / thickness / fixity** under a Cameron
  dichotomy, **not** WL-dim / `b(X)` / `c(X)`. Only general WL-dim ceiling is **linear** (0.15n, Schneider–Schweitzer
  ICALP'25; 0.05n even for fiber ≤ 7). See §4 for the strategically important *positive* findings.

**Verdict:** there is no single citable theorem giving `c(X_T)=O(1)` for the residue. A2 is genuine open research
(proving it in full would resolve a chunk of GI for the class). The only citable slice is cyclotomic `s(X)≤2` = the
already-closed affine slice. So the realistic endpoints are structured (§5–§6).

---

## 3. The central strategy question: uniform proof, or infinite ladder?

> **Can A2 be closed by a *uniform* argument (the unconditional seal), or only family-by-family (an infinite ladder)?**

The residue contains infinitely many families, so family-by-family never closes. Closure ⟺ a uniform statement — and
every uniform statement is the same open theorem (§1). So a "collapse the ladder" route must find a *proven* uniform
implication, not an empirical pattern; the families' common cause is exactly `c=O(1)` (circular) unless a *deeper* cause
is found. **The bounded rank (3–4) bounds the collapse target:** the ladder collapses to the **rank-3 base case**
("primitive, large-motion, non-conference SRG ⟹ `b(X)=O(log n)`"), with rank-4 amorphic morally easier (finer scheme).
That base case is "morally known" (Babai's quasipoly-GI algorithm individualizes few vertices for exactly these SRGs;
CGGP proves a family) but has **no portable proof**. §5 is the attack on it; §4 is why it's believable.

---

## 4. The evidence — probe (true) + research (carve validated, no falsifier)

### 4.1 — M1 probe (2026-06-13, `Theorem41ConditionsProbe.Probe_CXT_ScopingM1`, green): `c(X_T)=O(1)` is uniform

| scheme | n | rk | `c(X)` | `c(X₁)` | `c(X₂)` | `b(X)` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| amorph-Z4² | 16 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 2 |
| amorph-Z2⁴ | 16 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 |
| amorph-Z5² | 25 | 4 | 7 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| Paley-13/17/29/37/41 | 13–41 | 3 | 5/7/13/17/19 | **1** | 0 | 2 |
| Petersen | 10 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 |

Bare `c(X)` grows `~(n−1)/2` (dense) but **collapses to a small constant after O(1) individualizations, uniformly**
(`c(X₁) ≤ 4` across `n=10–41`, rank 3/4, cyclotomic/amorphic, char 2/odd). **No falsifier** (no scheme shows `c` growing).
`k(X₂)=O(1)` likewise. **Char-2 is the hard case** (slower collapse, `b=3`, needs `m=2`). So the target is *true*; the
constant varies by family but boundedness is uniform. (Caveat: testing the δ′ *closure* on `X_T` at a base is vacuous —
`X_T` is discrete there; the signal is the `c`-collapse.)

### 4.2 — A2-research (2026-06-14): the strategically decisive findings

- **The carve-out is VALIDATED.** Babai's SRG structure theorem (n≥29): a primitive SRG is either large-motion (≥ n/8 —
  the residue) OR triangular/Johnson `T(m)` / lattice/Hamming `L₂(m)` / disjoint-cliques — and those hard families all
  have **thickness ≥ √n = LARGE |Aut|** (→ Cameron) or are imprimitive. The one primitive base-size obstruction,
  **conference/Paley** (`O(log n)` base, unimproved 40 yrs), is **cyclotomic = abelian → leg B / the cited affine slice.**
  So every known unbounded/large-WL SRG is *already carved out* of the residue.
- **POSITIVE (decoupling).** The Fon-Der-Flaass / CGGP family (Combinatorica'25, arXiv:2312.00460) — `n^Ω(n^{2/3})`
  same-parameter primitive SRGs with **trivial automorphism groups** (small-`|Aut|`, non-Cameron = the residue) — ALL
  have **WL-dim ≤ 4**, via `base ≤ 2 ⟹ WL-dim ≤ 4` (affine-plane geometry, BCN Thm 3.3.8). So bounded WL-dim is
  **decoupled from `|Aut|`-largeness** — the residue *can* be tame, and this is the closest published positive mechanism.
- **NO falsifier found** — no primitive small-`|Aut|` SRG with provably unbounded WL-dim was located (nor formally excluded).

Net: the conjecture (residue has bounded WL-dim) is well-supported, and the hard cases are carved out — but no uniform
theorem covers the residue.

---

## 5. The attack on the unconditional seal (routes, ranked)

The unconditional goal needs A2 uniformly. The honest verdict (from §2–§4): **fully unconditional is not tractably
reachable by known means — it requires resolving the rank-3 base case, which is open.** The ladder collapses to *one*
hard theorem, not a cheap pattern. The routes, ranked by tractability-toward-unconditional:

1. **Probe-mine the collapse invariant (the prerequisite; cheap, concrete, DO FIRST).** Sweep the *primitive
   non-conference* residue broadly (rank-3 non-geometric SRGs, rank-4 amorphic, varied constructions, larger `n`) and
   correlate `b(X)`/`c`/`k` against structural invariants — spectral gap, eigenvalue multiplicity, p-rank / Smith form,
   "geometricity." Goal: does a *single* invariant provably control the base **and** is it provably bounded on the
   residue? YES → a real collapse mechanism to attempt (route 2). NO → confirms the conditional (route 3) is the floor.
   This is the "notice the pattern" step; it can't waste effort (sharpens both 2 and 3). Extend `Theorem41ConditionsProbe`.

2. **Attack the rank-3 base case (the path to unconditional; research-hard).** Re-derive Babai's non-conference-SRG
   splitting as a **base / WL-dim bound** (not an `|Aut|` bound), using the abelian/conference carve-out to dodge his
   published bottleneck. The genuine open math; no guarantee, but it's *one* problem, not infinitely many, and the probe
   (route 1) feeds it the candidate invariant. Rank-4 amorphic is morally easier (finer) — though not a clean reduction
   (constituents may be large).

3. **Collapse to one named conjecture (the honest floor; near-done).** Sharpen the carried `viaBoundedExtensionParams`
   predicate into a single named hypothesis — *"every primitive non-Cameron rank-≤4 CC has `b(X) = O(log n)"`* — and
   carry it. Collapses the infinite *family*-ladder to **one predicate**; the seal stands `modulo {G3 + one conjecture}`.
   Not unconditional, but the sharpest honest end-state — and essentially the wiring already landed (§S-gate2).

**Recommendation (toward the stated unconditional goal):** route 1 → route 2, with route 3 as the guaranteed floor.
Unconditional closes *iff* route 2 yields; that's the single point of risk. **Next concrete step = run the probe (route
1)** to test whether the base case is attackable via a clean invariant.

---

## 6. Honest endpoints, risks, and handoff

**Legitimate endpoints** (mirroring the affine slice's cited-`TwinsAreSemilinear` + finite-exceptions closure):
1. a **uniform** rank-3 (then rank-4) base-size theorem — the unconditional goal (route 2; research-hard);
2. a **structured-sub-family** discharge (CGGP `base≤2⟹WL≤4`, the affine slice) — partial, real, but a ladder;
3. a **carried predicate** (route 3) fed to the landed capstone — the honest floor, `modulo {G3 + one conjecture}`.

**Risks (plain):**
- **(a) `c(X_T)` NOT uniformly bounded** — a primitive small non-Cameron scheme with unbounded base = a **G2-B witness ⟹
  the seal is false** (a statement change; the §1A off-track falsifier). M1 + A2-research found **no witness** (and the
  carve-out removes every known unbounded-WL family), so empirically pushed back — not formally excluded. The probe
  (route 1) is also the falsifier hunt.
- **(b) uniform mechanism exists but the proof is genuinely hard** — the realistic case (the rank-3 base case); fall to
  endpoint 3.
- **(c) no clean invariant emerges** — route 1 returns nothing portable; endpoint 3 (carried predicate) is the floor.

**▶ PICK UP HERE (next concrete step):** **A1 + the A2 interface are LANDED** (`§CC.11`–`§CC.19` + `§S-gate2`
`reachesRigidOrCameron_viaBoundedExtensionParams`, all axiom-clean; build history in `chain-descent-a1-cc-substrate.md`).
The seal stands `modulo {G3 + the A2 inequality `(k(X_{T₀})−1)·c(X_{T₀}) < |T|` + hcatch + hImprim}`. **A2 is OPEN / not
citable** (§2). **Route = discharge the unconditional seal** (user decision 2026-06-14). **PROBE RUN + ROUTE CHOSEN
(2026-06-15):** the monovariant probe (`A2MonovariantProbe.cs`) found a clean signal — a potential (max-cell-size / `c`)
drops by a bounded factor on the residue but climbs to 1 on geometric SRGs (rook `((m−1)/m)²→1`), so **"bounded drop" =
"non-geometric", and "geometric" = the Cameron carve.** The live route is now the **potential-drop attack**, planned in
**`chain-descent-a2-potential-route.md`** (the drop lemma + Neumaier/CGGP dichotomy routing geometric→Cameron; the
conditional-predicate floor is route 3, retained). That doc supersedes the old probe plan
(archived: `Archive/ChainDescent/chain-descent-a2-monovariant-probe.md`).

**Reading order for a fresh reader:** build doc STATUS → its §1A (why not GI∈P) / §1B (everything ⟹ `c(X_T)`) → THIS
doc §0–§5 (the A2 target, evidence, and the route to the unconditional seal) → `CoherentConfig.lean §CC.10`–`§CC.19` (the
δ′ engine + the A1 abundance substrate + the A2 monotonicity interface) → `chain-descent-a1-cc-substrate.md` only if the
A1 build detail / route-not-taken is needed.
